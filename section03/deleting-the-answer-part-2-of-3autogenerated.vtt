00:02.710 --> 00:06.510
Now what if we deleted the answer that 
has been accepted as best answer?

1
00:06.510 --> 00:07.570
Do you have any idea?

2
00:08.480 --> 00:14.340
First, the answer should be prevent to removed and we can simply modify our delete method in the answer

3
00:14.340 --> 00:18.520
policy and write some logic to restrict the deletion.

4
00:18.530 --> 00:25.330
Second, the answer can be removed but we need to 
update the best answer id value in the Questions table.

5
00:25.490 --> 00:27.650
In this case we'll take the second way.

6
00:27.650 --> 00:33.290
The reason why I take the second way instead of the 
first one is because I have shown you how to

7
00:33.290 --> 00:33.870
do that

8
00:33.890 --> 00:39.410
In the previous section of the course and I'm sure you 
can do it yourself if you prefer the first way.

9
00:39.830 --> 00:45.920
That's why here I take the second way so that 
you'll see another possible solution. And to update the best

10
00:45.920 --> 00:48.930
answer id when the related answer removed

11
00:48.950 --> 00:51.770
we have two options and I'll show you one by one.

12
00:52.100 --> 00:55.640
But before that let's our file changes in our project to our repo

13
00:59.370 --> 01:06.070
so git add all and then commit the changes

14
01:07.970 --> 01:08.920
and say something

15
01:09.000 --> 01:15.120
let's say Implement delete functionality

16
01:16.010 --> 01:17.420
for answer.

17
01:21.540 --> 01:26.340
And now let's create new branch to isolate our work git check out

18
01:26.530 --> 01:32.460
-b and the branch name let's say lesson 19

19
01:32.570 --> 01:37.970
dash a.  All right we are in new branch

20
01:37.980 --> 01:38.930
and now let's see

21
01:38.940 --> 01:41.620
the first way to update best answer id.

22
01:41.640 --> 01:42.270
So here

23
01:44.920 --> 01:46.540
in static deleted let's

24
01:50.450 --> 01:52.260
assigned the question to a variable

25
02:01.790 --> 02:10.010
so we do this because we'll call this answer question not for once but for several times.

26
02:10.280 --> 02:11.480
And here we can change

27
02:14.100 --> 02:18.830
to question

28
02:19.550 --> 02:21.130
and here is the important part.

29
02:21.140 --> 02:27.710
So here we simply match the best answer id in the 
question model with id in the answer model

30
02:27.910 --> 02:40.660
and here we can say if question best answer id equals answer Id

31
02:47.830 --> 02:52.000
If yes then here we set the best answer Id to null like so.

32
02:52.150 --> 02:55.040
Question.

33
02:55.700 --> 03:04.710
best answer id equals null and don't forget to save it to database

34
03:10.240 --> 03:11.360
and that's all we need.

35
03:12.970 --> 03:23.570
So here we check if the deleted answer's id equals or identic with best answer id in question

36
03:23.570 --> 03:24.310
model

37
03:24.350 --> 03:31.770
If yes then we need to change the best answer id to null 
because the answer is no longer exist in database.

38
03:31.790 --> 03:41.130
Now let's save this and go to our browser. And here let's make two answers for this question.

39
03:43.320 --> 03:49.040
So I have one so here I'll add another answer.

40
03:56.640 --> 04:00.900
Now here we have two answers.

41
04:01.150 --> 04:03.160
Let's see the ID of the answers.

42
04:05.170 --> 04:10.800
24 And then here 8.

43
04:11.160 --> 04:16.460
So the first one is 8 and the second one is 24. Now

44
04:16.500 --> 04:17.550
let's make one of these

45
04:17.550 --> 04:18.440
answer as best

46
04:18.450 --> 04:19.500
answer

47
04:19.500 --> 04:24.990
Currently we have no future to accept the answer as 
best answer and we'll implement that in the other

48
04:24.990 --> 04:26.570
section of this course.

49
04:26.820 --> 04:29.520
For now let's do that  manually from tinker

50
04:30.120 --> 04:40.820
Switch over to our terminal and open thinker  
by saying: php artisan thinker. Here

51
04:40.840 --> 04:46.310
I need to get the question instance and then update the best answer id column and we can do that by

52
04:46.310 --> 04:47.510
saying

53
04:47.620 --> 04:54.140
Answer equals app answer

54
04:54.470 --> 04:56.030
find 8

55
04:59.100 --> 05:09.910
and then we can get a related question like this 
question equals answer question.

56
05:10.620 --> 05:13.120
Now let's update the best answer id of this question

57
05:18.380 --> 05:33.330
equals answer id and then save the change to our database.

58
05:33.390 --> 05:37.060
Here we set the best answer id to 8.

59
05:37.250 --> 05:39.080
Now if we go back to our browser

60
05:42.530 --> 05:53.680
actually let's go to answer model and here 
let's define new accessor

61
05:53.870 --> 05:58.510
I'm going to call it get status attribute

62
06:03.600 --> 06:06.400
and here let's return vote-accepted class

63
06:06.630 --> 06:11.130
If the answer's id equals to question best answer id

64
06:11.130 --> 06:22.390
So here we can say return this id equals this question

65
06:24.750 --> 06:25.870
best answer Id

66
06:29.440 --> 06:31.700
vote accepted

67
06:34.280 --> 06:36.940
Otherwise we return nothing.

68
06:38.620 --> 06:42.560
Now we can open answers underscore index.blade.php

69
06:45.250 --> 06:49.010
and here let's change 

70
06:49.050 --> 06:59.510
this to answer status. Save all changes

71
07:02.210 --> 07:03.640
reload the page

72
07:10.250 --> 07:16.350
Now here one of the answer indicated as best answer.

73
07:16.360 --> 07:22.090
For now let's remove this answer and we do this 
just to make sure that this deletion will not affect

74
07:22.090 --> 07:23.610
the best answer id

75
07:23.680 --> 07:27.000
Hit the delete button and then hit OK

76
07:34.350 --> 07:36.160
here the answer still marked as best

77
07:36.180 --> 07:37.000
answer

78
07:37.200 --> 07:37.790
And that's mean

79
07:37.830 --> 07:39.150
the best answer id column

80
07:39.150 --> 07:42.090
still store the answer id

81
07:42.120 --> 07:47.420
Now let's remove this answer and let's see if this 
deletion will affect the best answer id.

82
07:47.520 --> 07:49.880
Hit the delete button and hit OK.

83
07:58.520 --> 08:00.570
And to see if this is working

84
08:00.620 --> 08:01.750
let's see in our thinker

85
08:04.680 --> 08:06.180
let's find the question id

86
08:09.860 --> 08:10.160
here

87
08:10.160 --> 08:13.870
the question id is three.

88
08:14.040 --> 08:15.470
So let's get the question

89
08:25.190 --> 08:28.710
as we can see now the best answer id is null.

90
08:28.780 --> 08:34.560
So that's the first way how to update the best answer 
id column when the related answer are removed.

91
08:34.570 --> 08:36.140
Now let's see the second way.

92
08:36.310 --> 08:39.150
And before we do that let's save all changes to our repo

93
08:42.810 --> 08:55.100
git add all git commit and I'll say "update 
best answer Id on questions table

94
08:55.710 --> 09:03.020
when an answer removed using eloquent event".

95
09:06.780 --> 09:07.140
Alright

96
09:07.190 --> 09:09.750
now let's switch to our master branch

97
09:14.690 --> 09:17.180
and then create new brains to isolate the second way.
