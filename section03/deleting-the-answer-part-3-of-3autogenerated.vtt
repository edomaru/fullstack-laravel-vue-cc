00:05.280 --> 00:10.330
So now that you know to update the best answer id 
column in the questions table when the related

1
00:10.380 --> 00:14.430
answer removed from database by utilizing eloquent event.

2
00:14.640 --> 00:19.260
Now let's see another way of doing so in the database layer.

3
00:19.320 --> 00:27.360
Actually here we need to check out to lesson 19 not to 
master branch because the latest changes was isolated

4
00:27.370 --> 00:28.210
in that branch

5
00:34.250 --> 00:36.750
here the destroy method is empty.

6
00:37.330 --> 00:38.470
Let me see the answer

7
00:38.480 --> 00:47.480
model. And here to get status accessor is gone.
so we need to check out to lesson-19-a

8
00:47.600 --> 00:55.020
In this case so that we don't have to recreate the get status accessor. OK let's go back to our terminal

9
00:56.630 --> 00:59.890
and here let's check out to lesson-19-a

10
01:07.210 --> 01:09.600
and then we can remove the lesson-19-b

11
01:09.620 --> 01:20.280
branch.

12
01:20.510 --> 01:23.130
And now we can recreate the lesson-19-b

13
01:31.510 --> 01:32.020
OK

14
01:32.080 --> 01:37.680
we are in lesson-19-b branch. And we can 
continue to go over the second way.

15
01:37.780 --> 01:38.620
All right

16
01:38.620 --> 01:54.530
firstly let's create new migration. Here we can say php artisan make migration add foreign best answer id

17
01:55.670 --> 02:00.750
to questions questions table

18
02:03.380 --> 02:07.480
table equals questions.

19
02:12.850 --> 02:16.980
OK next let's open our migration file.

20
02:27.510 --> 02:34.320
And here in up method we can define foreign key 
for best answer id  by saying table

21
02:37.460 --> 02:37.940
foreign best answer

22
02:41.650 --> 02:42.140
id

23
02:48.650 --> 02:49.860
references id

24
02:55.160 --> 03:02.870
on answers on answers table and here are the important part

25
03:03.350 --> 03:05.090
So on delete

26
03:07.640 --> 03:08.780
SET NULL

27
03:12.010 --> 03:18.910
so whenever the answer which is mark as best answer 
in answers table removed we will set the foreign

28
03:18.910 --> 03:23.670
key which is best answer id to null

29
03:24.020 --> 03:30.310
And here in down method we simply drop 
the foreign key by saying table

30
03:34.060 --> 03:34.960
drop foreign

31
03:38.580 --> 03:40.980
and pass in array that contains best answer id

32
03:47.500 --> 03:48.650
and that's all we need.

33
03:50.850 --> 03:51.770
And here

34
03:55.540 --> 04:01.050
we don't need these lines.

35
04:01.310 --> 04:10.980
And then here I'll revert back to answer 
question decrement and remove this line

36
04:16.550 --> 04:17.860
and let's run our migration

37
04:23.790 --> 04:26.940
here our latest migration file has been migrated.

38
04:27.030 --> 04:28.550
Now let's go to our browser

39
04:31.340 --> 04:32.670
go to all questions

40
04:37.150 --> 04:38.430
choose any question

41
04:46.970 --> 04:48.500
and here I have two answers

42
04:52.150 --> 04:58.790
here I know that the idea is 23 let's reopen our tinker

43
05:07.390 --> 05:08.540
Here let's find the answer

44
05:08.540 --> 05:09.760
and assign to a variable

45
05:22.150 --> 05:35.270
and then get its question and assign to another variable.

46
05:35.280 --> 05:36.730
Now let's set the best answer id

47
05:36.730 --> 05:37.640
to 23

48
05:51.690 --> 05:55.190
and then save the changes to our database.

49
06:00.600 --> 06:05.920
All right let's go back to our browser reload the page

50
06:11.010 --> 06:11.650
here

51
06:11.690 --> 06:14.570
The answer marked as best answer. Now

52
06:14.600 --> 06:17.910
hit the delete button hit

53
06:17.920 --> 06:18.470
OK

54
06:26.110 --> 06:26.490
OK

55
06:26.500 --> 06:27.940
The answer has been deleted.

56
06:29.110 --> 06:37.530
Now let's go back to our tinker and see the question question

57
06:37.540 --> 06:39.690
spp question

58
06:40.130 --> 06:45.810
find the id is 4

59
06:52.390 --> 06:55.850
as you can see now the best answer id of the question is null

60
06:56.140 --> 07:01.350
And we do that without need to write something in 
our application code because we do that in database

61
07:01.390 --> 07:02.560
layer.

62
07:02.560 --> 07:08.830
All right so now that the you know two different ways to 
change the best answer id column in the Questions table

63
07:09.190 --> 07:16.660
to be null whenever the related answer which marked as 
best answer is removed. So from two options that I have

64
07:16.660 --> 07:23.200
explained which one do you prefer? Please decide which one do you prefer and then merge that with your

65
07:23.200 --> 07:24.810
master branch here

66
07:24.820 --> 07:31.010
I prefer the second option because if I deleted 
the best answer in answers table directly

67
07:31.030 --> 07:35.680
let's say I do that using phpmyadmin than 
it will affect the question table

68
07:35.730 --> 07:43.550
as we just did in our application but it will 
not happen if we chose the first option.

69
07:45.340 --> 07:53.380
All right let's save our changes to our git repo 
git add all git commit

70
07:57.160 --> 08:06.830
and I'll say update best answer id on questions table when

71
08:07.010 --> 08:08.050
answer

72
08:08.810 --> 08:09.600
removed

73
08:15.760 --> 08:18.010
in database layer

74
08:20.390 --> 08:22.410
Now I can switch to master branch

75
08:22.540 --> 08:25.050
git checkout master

76
08:28.640 --> 08:38.510
and then merge to lesson-19-b git merge lesson-19-b

77
08:42.510 --> 08:47.310
OK here I'll push the master branch to remote repo git push origin

78
08:47.330 --> 08:47.770
master

79
08:54.960 --> 09:01.290
and I also push button lesson-19-a and 
lesson-19-b to remote repo so that you can see

80
09:01.290 --> 09:02.290
my work.

81
09:02.500 --> 09:06.500
git push origin lesson 19

82
09:19.410 --> 09:21.990
and I should also push the lesson-19

83
09:31.730 --> 09:33.000
OK that's it

84
09:33.020 --> 09:34.420
I'll see you in the next lesson.
