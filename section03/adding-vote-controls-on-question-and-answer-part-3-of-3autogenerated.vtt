00:02.370 --> 00:09.450
Let's go to `assets/sass` folder and open `app.scss` file.

1
00:13.990 --> 00:16.300
here let's select our votes control element

2
00:21.200 --> 00:28.070
and firstly let's set the `min-with` to let's say 60 pixels

3
00:30.660 --> 00:33.830
min width

4
00:34.200 --> 00:39.850
So this will make sure that the width of our vote control 
not getting narrow if the votes counter in

5
00:39.850 --> 00:41.220
a small number.

6
00:41.220 --> 00:44.120
And then let's set the margin right

7
00:46.820 --> 00:53.080
to 30 pixels and then make the text align

8
00:58.050 --> 00:59.580
to center.

9
01:01.840 --> 01:13.560
Then here let's also custom the font color to gray 700. 
Where this variable come from?

10
01:13.840 --> 01:15.960
This come from

11
01:16.100 --> 01:17.100
let's go to

12
01:17.150 --> 01:22.420
node_modules and open bootstrap

13
01:26.980 --> 01:34.770
go to sass folder.

14
01:34.890 --> 01:37.590
And if you open _variables

15
01:42.560 --> 01:45.010
here we can see some color variables.

16
01:45.020 --> 01:48.380
And here the gray 700

17
01:48.800 --> 01:53.300
So feel free to choose the color you like but here I'll choose these gray

18
01:53.330 --> 01:56.140
700

19
01:56.220 --> 01:57.340
All right

20
01:57.870 --> 02:00.260
let's also select span and anchor element

21
02:03.600 --> 02:05.790
and change the display as block element

22
02:11.040 --> 02:12.290
save all changes.

23
02:13.850 --> 02:15.450
And let's have a look.

24
02:24.670 --> 02:25.750
All right

25
02:26.090 --> 02:33.530
Now we have more space between vote controls and question 
the text align center and elements inside

26
02:33.590 --> 02:38.030
are display as block element. OK let's make further styling.

27
02:41.890 --> 02:45.370
Let's select only span element and define css rule

28
02:51.740 --> 02:55.760
if you remember span in vote controllers are used to place number

29
02:58.640 --> 03:01.100
so here and here

30
03:04.270 --> 03:08.560
here I'm going to make this bigger and  
I'm gonna make this smaller

31
03:12.290 --> 03:18.330
so here I can write ampersand dot votes-count.

32
03:19.660 --> 03:23.100
Remember that ampersand represents the parent selector.

33
03:23.260 --> 03:32.230
So this will produced selector like this

34
03:33.220 --> 03:38.260
and here I'll set the font size to 25 pixels

35
03:41.590 --> 03:43.790
and then let's also have favorites-count

36
03:50.150 --> 03:55.670
and then set the font size to 12 pixels

37
04:02.190 --> 04:02.960
next

38
04:03.040 --> 04:05.680
let's define css rule for anchors

39
04:06.420 --> 04:12.040
So this one this one and this one.

40
04:12.150 --> 04:21.130
And here we will apply the same style to them so here we can select them just using element type like this

41
04:22.360 --> 04:27.220
and this will select all controls because they are anchor elements.

42
04:27.250 --> 04:33.240
You can also select them with the most specific because maybe in the future you will be add other anchors

43
04:33.520 --> 04:36.350
and you don't want them to get applied the style.

44
04:36.580 --> 04:38.680
So you can do like this

45
04:41.640 --> 04:51.020
vote-up vote- down and favorite.

46
04:51.530 --> 04:54.170
And here you can specify the style

47
04:54.170 --> 05:00.620
but in this case we will not need to add any anchors 
just vote-up vote-down and favorite.

48
05:00.680 --> 05:08.390
So here we can simply use just this type selector and we don't have to specify the classes.

49
05:12.190 --> 05:14.270
Also we don't need to remove that classes

50
05:14.290 --> 05:16.590
In our view just keep them.

51
05:16.600 --> 05:22.450
Sometimes we need to define classes or other attributes in our element just to make our markup semantic

52
05:22.780 --> 05:26.570
or to make our markup easier to read and easier to maintenance.

53
05:27.280 --> 05:30.100
Ok here let's change the cursor to pointer

54
05:36.240 --> 05:42.960
and change the text color to gray 600

55
05:46.620 --> 05:52.690
next let's also define css rule for off class.

56
05:52.780 --> 05:54.310
Also when the element hovered

57
05:59.130 --> 06:04.060
and here let's change the text color to be a bit light gray

58
06:11.950 --> 06:17.550
and then let's define another rule that's going to be used to indicate that the question is being

59
06:17.590 --> 06:18.470
favorited

60
06:18.490 --> 06:21.850
So here the class will be favorited

61
06:30.920 --> 06:36.580
And here let's change the text color to yellow

62
06:38.360 --> 06:39.470
or warning

63
06:42.230 --> 06:43.090
like so.

64
06:43.460 --> 06:45.740
So this color came from

65
06:52.050 --> 06:52.650
here

66
06:56.660 --> 06:57.360
and here.

67
07:02.180 --> 07:10.540
And here we will make sure that this class can only be applied to element that has favorite class.

68
07:10.670 --> 07:15.790
That's why here we need to define favorite

69
07:20.010 --> 07:21.870
and then move these

70
07:25.270 --> 07:26.450
inside here.

71
07:29.190 --> 07:36.190
Save all changes wait for a second.

72
07:36.420 --> 07:38.480
Here it say "Build successful"

73
07:38.490 --> 07:41.160
Now let's have a look reload the page

74
07:44.530 --> 07:45.810
as you can see here

75
07:45.990 --> 07:48.270
the vote counts look bigger

76
07:48.370 --> 07:50.960
Well favorites count smaller.

77
07:51.080 --> 07:58.180
Here we can see the vote up color a bit dark gray while the vote down off has a bit light gray color.

78
07:58.400 --> 08:03.530
And here I think we need more space between favorite

79
08:03.540 --> 08:08.810
icon with vote down icon

80
08:19.520 --> 08:24.090
so here I'll add margin top two

81
08:28.530 --> 08:28.700
And here I'll

82
08:28.710 --> 08:40.070
also try to add favorited class.

83
08:40.070 --> 08:40.880
All right

84
08:40.880 --> 08:43.160
I think it's look better.

85
08:43.340 --> 08:49.590
Now let's copy this control to our answer item.

86
08:49.800 --> 08:51.220
Let's go back to our editor

87
08:59.220 --> 09:00.890
select this lines.

88
09:02.620 --> 09:03.300
Copy

89
09:06.030 --> 09:06.780
and then

90
09:10.250 --> 09:11.170
and then paste here

91
09:19.090 --> 09:27.520
and here we'll keep the vote up votes count and vote down. All we need to do is make a little change

92
09:28.200 --> 09:42.140
title from question to answer and we don't need this favorite control. Actually let's change this class

93
09:42.220 --> 09:43.880
to vote

94
09:44.030 --> 09:44.690
accept

95
09:51.300 --> 09:52.970
and then change the title

96
09:57.050 --> 10:08.390
let's say "Mark this answer as best answer" and here 
let's change the icon to

97
10:11.380 --> 10:15.680
check.

98
10:16.500 --> 10:23.130
So this control allows the creator of the question to accept the particular answer as best answer

99
10:23.750 --> 10:27.620
and this control will be has two possible conditions.

100
10:27.620 --> 10:29.110
The answer not accepted

101
10:29.270 --> 10:31.520
and we need to add vote-accept class.

102
10:31.790 --> 10:35.280
And when the answer has been accepted we need to add vote

103
10:35.300 --> 10:36.260
accepted.

104
10:36.260 --> 10:40.460
All right let's save the change and see how it looks like

105
10:47.120 --> 10:48.580
OK here it is.

106
10:53.810 --> 10:58.620
Now let's go back to our editor and here

107
10:59.050 --> 11:06.610
let's change this to vote-accepted and then switch to app.scss

108
11:10.130 --> 11:14.110
and here let's define new css rule for vote-accepted

109
11:22.990 --> 11:25.630
here we simply change the text color to

110
11:25.950 --> 11:26.380
green

111
11:31.700 --> 11:35.590
again this green variable is come from bootstrap variables.

112
11:35.780 --> 11:36.740
Save all changes

113
11:43.100 --> 11:46.860
reload the page.

114
11:46.990 --> 11:51.470
All right now the accept control is in green color.

115
11:51.760 --> 11:56.300
So as I said this green color will indicate that the answer has been accepted.

116
12:00.400 --> 12:06.040
But of course there should be only one answer as accepted answer and we will implement that

117
12:06.040 --> 12:09.150
in other section of this course.

118
12:09.230 --> 12:13.980
All right so now that we have vote controls 
added both in question and answer.

119
12:14.030 --> 12:18.910
While implementation of these controls will be discussed in other section of this course.

120
12:19.430 --> 12:20.390
OK that's it

121
12:20.480 --> 12:24.400
Let's close this lesson and save what we made today 
into our git repo

122
12:27.440 --> 12:27.980
first

123
12:27.980 --> 12:35.380
let's stop the webpack by hitting control+c

124
12:35.620 --> 12:41.420
then git add all. git commit

125
12:41.940 --> 12:45.080
-m and say a message

126
12:58.460 --> 12:59.000
here

127
12:59.040 --> 13:01.470
I'll push my current branch to my remote server

128
13:13.040 --> 13:14.510
and then switch to master branch

129
13:20.300 --> 13:21.920
and merge to lesson-16

130
13:28.370 --> 13:28.700
and last

131
13:28.700 --> 13:30.530
I'll push my master branch to remote server
