00:02.010 --> 00:06.730
In the last lesson we have displayed all answers 
in the show question page.

1
00:06.810 --> 00:12.830
Now in this lesson we are going to add something that very useful in question answer application that

2
00:12.840 --> 00:19.400
is vote control which allows us to vote the question or answer. In this lesson will also integrate font awesome

3
00:19.410 --> 00:23.280
5 into our project and write some sass code again

4
00:23.320 --> 00:29.580
to style our vote control. Actually implementing the vote control or make the vote control actually

5
00:29.580 --> 00:33.870
work is tricky and it's not enough to discussing one lesson.

6
00:33.960 --> 00:37.800
So in this lesson we'll only build the mark up and then style it.

7
00:38.560 --> 00:44.310
And we will implement all functionality of the vote control system in the other section of this course.

8
00:44.320 --> 00:46.190
All right let's switch to our terminal

9
00:49.600 --> 00:53.170
and then create new branch saying git check out

10
00:53.170 --> 01:02.500
-b and here I'll call it lesson-16.

11
01:02.620 --> 01:04.140
Now let's open

12
01:04.150 --> 01:05.840
show.blade.php

13
01:12.750 --> 01:17.810
and before going any further let's make a little changes to this markup.

14
01:17.870 --> 01:25.260
So here is last change this card-header to card-title.

15
01:25.430 --> 01:32.280
And then here let's change this card-body to media

16
01:35.660 --> 01:40.590
then we need to wrap everything inside this media

17
01:44.230 --> 02:03.300
with media body.

18
02:03.340 --> 02:12.640
And lastly we need to wrap both card title 
and media with card-body

19
02:45.560 --> 02:46.310
save.

20
02:46.620 --> 02:47.280
And let's see

21
02:53.020 --> 02:53.900
OK great.

22
02:53.980 --> 02:56.860
I only need to add horizontal rule here

23
03:11.840 --> 03:12.520
OK.

24
03:15.800 --> 03:22.610
Now here we'll place the vote control on the left side of both question body and answer item as you may

25
03:22.610 --> 03:27.500
saw in stackoverflow. Here I'll be adding it 
on the left side of the question

26
03:27.510 --> 03:36.280
body first and once it done I'll copy it and adding 
on the left side of the answer item.

27
03:36.320 --> 03:42.070
So here inside media object let's add a new div

28
03:45.630 --> 03:58.370
and give classes d-flex column.

29
03:58.940 --> 04:01.870
So actually this is almost the same as we did in question

30
04:01.870 --> 04:09.710
Index. We utilize bootstrap flexbox and then we'll add flex column to set vertical direction or put

31
04:09.710 --> 04:18.660
the item inside in stack. And here we'll also add another class 
so that we can select this element and

32
04:18.660 --> 04:20.630
child element inside it.

33
04:20.640 --> 04:24.130
So here let's call it foot controls.

34
04:25.420 --> 04:28.910
Inside here let's add a new anchor

35
04:29.180 --> 04:34.530
And here we can specify title attribute and saying

36
04:34.720 --> 04:41.610
"This question is useful".

37
04:41.730 --> 04:43.390
Let's also specify class attribute

38
04:47.230 --> 04:50.080
and the value will be vote up

39
05:00.420 --> 05:06.060
inside this anchor We will show triangle icon 
by utilizing frontawesome 5.

40
05:06.360 --> 05:12.910
But since it hasn't installed yet so for now let's just say "vote up"

41
05:15.740 --> 05:21.490
below that let's show the number of votes 
and we'll place it in a span

42
05:23.120 --> 05:31.930
Let's give it a class votes count and give it 
a static number for a while.

43
05:36.970 --> 05:41.850
Next we'll also need to add another anchor that allows us to vote down the question.

44
05:42.310 --> 05:53.380
So anchor title and saying "This question is not useful".

45
05:56.180 --> 06:01.470
Let's also give it a class vote-down. Actually

46
06:01.540 --> 06:08.280
let's add another class off to indicate that the button is off.

47
06:08.340 --> 06:16.140
For example if a user has not sign in this class would be applied to indicate that he or she can't hit

48
06:16.140 --> 06:17.640
the button.

49
06:17.640 --> 06:22.890
Basically this class can be applied to 
vote up, vote down and favorite

50
06:23.040 --> 06:25.580
button. For now I'll only put it just here.

51
06:32.590 --> 06:33.210
OK

52
06:33.240 --> 06:35.520
The text will be vote down.

53
06:38.220 --> 06:38.920
Last

54
06:39.130 --> 06:50.720
let's also add another anchor that allows us to mark the question as favorite so anchor title and we are

55
06:50.720 --> 07:00.190
going to say "Click to mark as favorite question

56
07:00.410 --> 07:05.800
click again to undo".

57
07:06.430 --> 07:09.070
Here I'll give it a class favorite

58
07:19.130 --> 07:21.600
the text will be favorite for now.

59
07:23.880 --> 07:27.720
And here we also need to show how many people that favorite

60
07:27.780 --> 07:31.080
this question. Here I'll place it in a span

61
07:33.900 --> 07:40.950
and let's give it a class favorites-count

62
07:41.170 --> 07:45.240
Let's say one two three.

63
07:45.360 --> 07:45.820
All right

64
07:45.820 --> 07:48.290
let's save all changes and see how it looked like.

65
07:54.980 --> 07:55.660
Now

66
07:55.720 --> 08:00.410
here we have vote controls on the left side of the question.

67
08:00.820 --> 08:05.650
We still need to do a couple of things to make this controls look better but I think this is a good

68
08:05.650 --> 08:06.120
progress.
