Alright now we can go back to our view 
and show our flash message.

1
00:06.320 --> 00:13.660
So let's open answers index.blade.php

2
00:13.770 --> 00:25.050
And here we can render our flash message 
by simply say include layouts underscore messages.

3
00:29.550 --> 00:29.820
Next

4
00:29.820 --> 00:31.800
let's go to our answer form

5
00:34.800 --> 00:36.860
and here

6
00:37.450 --> 00:41.220
we can change this action's value to route

7
00:45.840 --> 00:59.600
questions dot answers dot store and pass the question instance or question id in the second argument.

8
01:04.000 --> 01:04.790
And last

9
01:04.820 --> 01:08.020
let's also show the validation error message in the answer's body

10
01:11.780 --> 01:15.050
here we'll add after a form control the bootstrap is invalid

11
01:15.050 --> 01:25.450
class.

12
01:25.800 --> 01:33.290
So if the body input has error we add is-invalid

13
01:33.290 --> 01:37.610
class otherwise we'll add nothing.

14
01:44.820 --> 01:48.660
Let's also add invalid-feedback in the bottom of the answer's body.

15
01:49.380 --> 01:52.290
So if errors

16
01:55.010 --> 01:55.880
has body

17
02:05.970 --> 02:11.610
and then here we show the validation error message 
by wrapping it inside invalid-feedback.

18
02:38.530 --> 02:40.650
Alright now let's save all changes

19
02:44.670 --> 02:45.420
and then

20
02:48.290 --> 02:49.170
reload the page

21
02:58.180 --> 03:02.160
let the answer's body empty and then hit the submit button.

22
03:03.850 --> 03:07.690
Ups  question does not exist.

23
03:08.570 --> 03:09.630
Let me check.

24
03:14.950 --> 03:15.460
OK

25
03:15.460 --> 03:21.380
Here I need to import this namespace on the top here.

26
03:24.520 --> 03:30.600
Save reload again continue.

27
03:37.160 --> 03:41.330
Here we can see the validation error message on the bottom.

28
03:41.340 --> 03:44.210
Now if we enter something here

29
03:50.870 --> 03:55.400
and then hit submit button the answer should be stored in our database.

30
03:56.740 --> 03:58.360
Ups I get another error

31
04:01.610 --> 04:05.430
actually we need to specify the column names in the fillable attributes 

32
04:05.430 --> 04:08.840
in our Answer model. Let's open

33
04:08.840 --> 04:15.290
the answer mode.

34
04:15.930 --> 04:17.990
And here let's define fillable attribute

35
04:21.980 --> 04:25.340
and then specify body and user_id

36
04:29.560 --> 04:35.090
save that. Reload again and hit continue.

37
04:42.740 --> 04:49.330
All right now we have success method show up 
and the answer saved and added here.

38
04:49.360 --> 04:51.180
Now let me go back to all questions

39
04:57.240 --> 04:58.920
and see another question.

40
05:03.390 --> 05:05.110
And here I'll enter another answer.

41
05:10.180 --> 05:18.120
And then hit the submit button.

42
05:18.140 --> 05:20.240
All right the answer has been successfully saved

43
05:23.040 --> 05:24.000
OK with that

44
05:24.000 --> 05:29.910
I'm going to my terminal and I'll save all changes to my git repo.
