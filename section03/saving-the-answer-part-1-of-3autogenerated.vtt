In the previous lesson you've seen how the answer is loaded from database and then presented in our

1
00:06.710 --> 00:07.810
application.

2
00:07.820 --> 00:13.730
Now in this lesson we'll be doing a little bit changes in `show` view because we put the question detail

3
00:14.060 --> 00:17.430
and all related answers together in a single file.

4
00:17.450 --> 00:23.160
I think it would be better to split them into separate files 
because it will make our code better organized

5
00:23.300 --> 00:30.050
and easy to maintain. After we've done that then we'll get into building out a new feature that allows us

6
00:30.050 --> 00:33.290
to be able to create new answer on any questions.

7
00:33.290 --> 00:46.150
All right let's switch over to our terminal and create new branch.

8
00:46.230 --> 00:47.340
Now let's open

9
00:47.410 --> 00:53.070
show.blade.php

10
00:53.220 --> 00:58.520
And here we have a bunch of code to show question body and all related answers

11
00:58.650 --> 01:01.680
just in a single file.

12
01:01.680 --> 01:07.620
So before we continue to build answer form 
let's split the code from this file into a separate

13
01:07.620 --> 01:08.610
file.

14
01:08.610 --> 01:22.960
I think it would be better to put the question part in one file and answers part in another.

15
01:23.010 --> 01:25.390
So here let's cut these answers part.

16
01:27.790 --> 01:29.040
Go to views

17
01:30.230 --> 01:31.540
and here let's create

18
01:31.540 --> 01:32.270
new folder

19
01:35.550 --> 01:38.240
and call it answers

20
01:41.400 --> 01:42.920
inside this folder

21
01:43.080 --> 01:55.340
let's create new file and call it let's say _index.blade.php again

22
01:55.430 --> 01:59.870
here's the underscore in the front of the file name in Laravel is not necessary.

23
01:59.870 --> 02:01.480
You don't have to follow that

24
02:01.610 --> 02:08.090
this just my style preference to indicate that 
this file is partial file and it will be included in

25
02:08.090 --> 02:12.090
other view. Inside this file

26
02:12.130 --> 02:13.850
just paste the previous code

27
02:23.150 --> 02:25.230
here in the heading

28
02:25.290 --> 02:26.250
let's change this

29
02:29.280 --> 02:40.440
to`answersCount` and change this for each to `answers`.

30
02:42.500 --> 02:51.230
Now we can switch to show.blade.php and here we can 
include our view by calling `include`. The first argument

31
02:51.230 --> 02:54.560
will be our partial view or child view

32
02:54.830 --> 03:09.250
in this case `answers._index` and here because 
we call `answersCount` and `answers`

33
03:09.330 --> 03:17.130
So here we can define that variables by specify in the second argument an array. In here we simply map the

34
03:17.130 --> 03:21.880
variable that will be exist in our child view with any value.

35
03:21.930 --> 03:23.670
So `answers`

36
03:28.340 --> 03:36.750
question answers and then `answersCount`

37
03:41.690 --> 03:44.860
question answers

38
03:45.050 --> 03:48.540
count. Let's save all changes.

39
03:51.210 --> 03:54.700
And let's make sure that our show question page 
is working as it was

40
04:04.070 --> 04:04.480
OK

41
04:04.480 --> 04:07.040
It's working as it was and we were ready to go.
