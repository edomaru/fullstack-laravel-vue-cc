00:01.750 --> 00:05.960
And the last thing that we need to do 
is create our answers dot edit view.

1
00:05.960 --> 00:11.320
So let's open _create.blade.php

2
00:14.950 --> 00:16.700
here we have only one input

3
00:16.900 --> 00:20.850
and I think we won't need to add other input in the future.

4
00:20.890 --> 00:26.830
So here we don't need to split the form into separate file 
as we did before and we simply save this

5
00:26.830 --> 00:35.760
file as new file and call it edit.blade.php

6
00:39.310 --> 00:39.660
again

7
00:39.670 --> 00:45.430
don't confuse with this file naming this as my current style preference and it will not affect to our

8
00:45.430 --> 00:47.610
laravel  application to work

9
00:47.620 --> 00:48.080
All right

10
00:48.080 --> 00:52.920
here let's replace the existing heading to Heading 1

11
00:58.290 --> 01:01.260
and the text is going to be editing

12
01:01.590 --> 01:05.230
answer for question

13
01:10.520 --> 01:12.270
question title.

14
01:19.390 --> 01:25.210
And here the form action will be questions dot answers dot

15
01:25.690 --> 01:32.400
update. And pass in array contains question id and answer id

16
01:37.820 --> 01:44.300
and don't forget here we need to define method field 
to tell laravel what method we will be used

17
01:44.390 --> 01:46.130
to perform this action.

18
01:46.140 --> 01:54.610
Here you can utilize blade directive method and the method will be `put` on a `patch`. Here

19
01:54.650 --> 01:57.300
since we only have one attributes we updated

20
01:57.430 --> 01:59.590
I think `patch` is better.

21
01:59.590 --> 02:03.250
So if you have multiple attributes to be updated it is better to use

22
02:03.250 --> 02:04.150
`put`

23
02:04.390 --> 02:05.760
But if you have only one

24
02:05.830 --> 02:07.430
The `patch` is perfect choice.

25
02:16.950 --> 02:32.190
Let's show the old answer by calling old body and then 
pass in the answer body in the second argument.

26
02:37.260 --> 02:43.560
Here we also need to change the bottom's text to update.

27
02:43.570 --> 02:44.100
All right

28
02:44.110 --> 02:52.750
save all changes.

29
02:53.980 --> 02:56.710
Ups this is not what I expected.

30
02:56.710 --> 02:59.500
So let me see.

31
02:59.600 --> 03:10.610
And yeah we need to extend from our layout. So let me open questions edit.blade.php and here

32
03:10.660 --> 03:12.160
let's copy these lines

33
03:15.890 --> 03:18.100
and paste here.

34
03:18.100 --> 03:22.560
Select from here all the way down. Cut

35
03:25.310 --> 03:30.870
close the container and end section

36
03:34.930 --> 03:36.880
and then paste inside here

37
03:45.310 --> 03:46.240
save

38
03:47.620 --> 03:48.210
reload again.

39
03:52.330 --> 03:59.750
Alright here our answer edit form and here the existing answer fill the text area. Let's change

40
03:59.750 --> 04:00.410
something here

41
04:03.290 --> 04:04.450
and hit update button

42
04:10.200 --> 04:12.400
here we have success message

43
04:12.530 --> 04:13.950
"Your answer has been updated".

44
04:17.720 --> 04:20.130
And here it has been changed.

45
04:20.630 --> 04:21.550
Okay great.

46
04:21.560 --> 04:28.140
So no we almost implement a full set of crud functionality 
for answer. One that we haven't implemented

47
04:28.140 --> 04:32.220
yet is the delete answer and we'll do that in the next lesson.

48
04:32.220 --> 04:32.750
All right

49
04:32.770 --> 04:36.900
let's save all changes into our git repo 
and I'll see you in the next lesson.
