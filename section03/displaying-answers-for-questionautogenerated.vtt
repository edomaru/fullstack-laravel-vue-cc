00:01.440 --> 00:07.930
In the previous lesson we have inserted our `answers` table with some fake answers programmatically by utilizing

1
00:07.930 --> 00:10.180
model factories and database seed.

2
00:10.440 --> 00:16.380
Now in this lesson we will come back to the 
show question page and display all related answers

3
00:16.380 --> 00:18.060
on this page.

4
00:18.060 --> 00:23.340
All right before we moving on as always 
let's go ahead and open our terminal

5
00:26.180 --> 00:31.540
and create new branch by saying: git checkout -b

6
00:31.760 --> 00:35.840
And then the branch name will be lesson-15

7
00:40.410 --> 00:40.950
OK

8
00:40.950 --> 00:47.930
now let's open show.blade.php

9
00:48.180 --> 00:51.150
And here we will display the answers in a new row

10
00:51.270 --> 00:58.260
So here let's fold or hide the content of this row and blow that

11
00:58.550 --> 01:03.350
let's create a new div and give it to class row

12
01:10.160 --> 01:11.280
inside this div

13
01:11.540 --> 01:12.770
let's create another div

14
01:16.380 --> 01:23.300
and give it a class called `md-12` to make the answer in full with

15
01:29.340 --> 01:30.380
inside this div

16
01:30.590 --> 01:32.580
let's utilize bootstrap card component.

17
01:32.780 --> 01:37.510
So div class card

18
01:43.200 --> 01:46.010
Here we need to wrap the question body in `cart-body`

19
01:55.730 --> 01:56.200
end here

20
01:56.210 --> 01:58.130
let's also add card title

21
02:08.860 --> 02:10.480
Inside this card title

22
02:10.540 --> 02:11.590
let's add heading two

23
02:20.590 --> 02:58.210
and here I'm going to show the total number of answers of the current question.

24
02:58.230 --> 03:02.980
Let's also add horizontal rule to a separate card title with our answer.

25
03:06.160 --> 03:08.670
And finally here we will display all answers.

26
03:08.890 --> 03:13.330
So for each question

27
03:17.350 --> 03:21.280
answers as

28
03:21.330 --> 03:21.820
answer

29
03:24.590 --> 03:26.470
and close the for each loop

30
03:35.010 --> 03:40.480
and inside this loop we will display every 
single answer into bootstrap media object

31
03:40.480 --> 03:45.220
Actually this is exactly the same thing 
as we did when displaying question item.

32
03:45.490 --> 03:49.840
So div class `media`

33
03:55.160 --> 04:04.670
and here we'll wrap the answer's body in 
`media-body` class so div class `media-body`

34
04:10.430 --> 04:12.560
and finally here we show the answer's body

35
04:23.520 --> 04:27.100
OK save that and let's have a look.

36
04:38.320 --> 04:40.550
Here we have two answers

37
04:40.740 --> 04:47.010
and here we need some space between the question body and answers.

38
04:47.010 --> 04:53.620
also we need to add horizontal rule to separate one answer with another.

39
04:53.650 --> 05:04.390
So let's go back to our editor and here in the row 
I'll add margin top up by utilizing bootstrap class mt

40
05:05.800 --> 05:11.680
three and then here I'll add horizontal rule

41
05:15.360 --> 05:22.410
save and reload again.

42
05:22.490 --> 05:23.600
Here our answers

43
05:29.840 --> 05:31.800
I think it's still too close.

44
05:31.970 --> 05:32.540
So

45
05:35.840 --> 05:38.670
I'll change this to `mt-4`

46
05:43.480 --> 05:46.850
Reload again. OK

47
05:46.850 --> 05:47.680
I think it's good.

48
05:51.170 --> 06:00.630
Next let's also add other info and creation date 
in both question body and answer item.

49
06:00.630 --> 06:05.290
And here I'll place it on the bottom right.

50
06:05.350 --> 06:07.060
So let's switch to our editor

51
06:11.580 --> 06:19.480
and here after answer's body let's create a new div.

52
06:19.630 --> 06:23.920
And as I said I'll place the author info and 
creation date on the right.

53
06:24.040 --> 06:29.230
So for now I'll be using `float-right`

54
06:37.890 --> 06:38.340
here

55
06:38.380 --> 06:45.690
firstly I'll show the answer creation date. I will be add 
a `span` inside a paragraph because in

56
06:45.700 --> 06:48.450
bootstrap it has some extra space on the bottom.

57
06:49.360 --> 06:58.100
And then I'll give it the class `text-muted` to make the font color a little bit gray.

58
07:05.120 --> 07:07.850
And here the txt will be answered

59
07:09.110 --> 07:11.800
and then the answer's creation date.

60
07:20.710 --> 07:25.430
Below that I'll show the author's avatar on the left and the name on the right.

61
07:25.450 --> 07:30.460
So here I'll create another div and give it a class `media`

62
07:38.100 --> 07:38.600
here

63
07:38.640 --> 07:41.280
I'll create an anchor.

64
07:41.440 --> 07:42.850
The ref will be

65
07:45.590 --> 07:46.190
answer

66
07:48.620 --> 07:49.700
user

67
07:49.930 --> 07:50.700
url

68
07:56.580 --> 08:02.730
and give it to bootstrap class `pr-2` or padding right two

69
08:11.290 --> 08:23.960
and here I'll add I `img` and the source will be answer user avatar

70
08:28.200 --> 08:31.400
Note here that the avatar is currently doesn't exist

71
08:31.400 --> 08:32.340
in our model

72
08:32.460 --> 08:41.060
And we will again define new accessor for that just in a second.

73
08:41.240 --> 08:42.930
And lastly I'll create a new div

74
08:46.740 --> 08:52.790
and give it a class `media-body`.

75
08:58.390 --> 08:59.120
Again

76
08:59.190 --> 09:01.170
I'll put the user's name in anchor

77
09:07.050 --> 09:08.830
The href will be

78
09:08.840 --> 09:11.790
answer user

79
09:12.390 --> 09:12.950
url

80
09:19.160 --> 09:23.890
and the text will be answer

81
09:24.450 --> 09:35.310
user name

82
09:35.530 --> 09:37.850
All right let's open question model

83
09:42.340 --> 09:43.040
here

84
09:45.670 --> 09:51.520
Let's copy the created_date accessor then let's open

85
09:51.610 --> 09:52.480
Answer Model

86
09:58.140 --> 10:00.320
and paste here.

87
10:00.400 --> 10:03.070
Now let's open user model

88
10:09.350 --> 10:26.510
and then here let's create new accessor so public function get avatar attribute.

89
10:26.770 --> 10:31.340
And here we will be using Gravatar or global recognize avatar.

90
10:31.360 --> 10:37.850
So let's switch to our browser and navigate to Gravatar dot com.

91
10:42.400 --> 10:45.370
Let's hit how to use gravatar menu

92
10:49.200 --> 10:50.850
choose php

93
10:54.320 --> 10:56.330
and here let's copy this code

94
10:58.150 --> 11:00.660
And paste inside our accessor

95
11:04.980 --> 11:06.660
here are i'll change

96
11:06.660 --> 11:18.110
The email's  value with current users email 
this email and here you can provide the default avatar

97
11:18.110 --> 11:27.350
image to somewhere. Here I want to use gravatar's 
default image. I'll remove this and for the size I'll change

98
11:27.350 --> 11:30.690
this to 32.

99
11:31.070 --> 11:37.690
Let's go back to gravatar page and here we need to copy this code.

100
11:41.580 --> 11:42.520
Paste here

101
11:43.740 --> 11:52.200
Remove these grav_url variable and add 
return to return the Gravatar

102
12:03.020 --> 12:09.040
and because I have removed the default image

103
12:09.180 --> 12:14.280
so here I also need to remove the default image variable from this query string.

104
12:22.900 --> 12:24.080
save all changes.

105
12:26.900 --> 12:28.420
And let's take a look.

106
12:41.230 --> 12:43.370
Now here we have answers

107
12:43.390 --> 12:47.030
Info avatar and answer creation date.

108
12:47.310 --> 12:48.160
Here I think

109
12:48.160 --> 12:51.700
the creation date and user's avatar is to close

110
12:51.750 --> 12:54.670
So let me add margin top here so

111
12:59.680 --> 13:00.820
let me add

112
13:01.730 --> 13:13.830
Margin top here.

113
13:13.870 --> 13:17.530
Now I need to move the user's name down a bit.

114
13:19.420 --> 13:20.820
So let me add

115
13:24.000 --> 13:27.680
`mt-1` or margin top one

116
13:35.120 --> 13:38.330
all right I think it's a lot better. Now

117
13:38.670 --> 13:46.080
let's also add user info and creation date 
in bottom right of the question.

118
13:46.160 --> 13:47.960
Let's go back to our editor.

119
13:48.680 --> 13:51.250
And here we simply copy these lines

120
13:53.280 --> 13:54.620
go to question body

121
14:01.750 --> 14:02.730
and paste those in

122
14:09.050 --> 14:11.900
save and reload the page

123
14:15.630 --> 14:17.420
ups

124
14:17.490 --> 14:19.760
Sorry I need to change this

125
14:24.230 --> 14:24.860
to

126
14:24.940 --> 14:25.450
question

127
14:28.000 --> 14:31.280
save reload again

128
14:35.320 --> 14:37.720
OK great. Last

129
14:37.810 --> 14:43.530
let's see and analyze the queries that being executed 
just to show all these answers.

130
14:43.760 --> 14:46.000
I'll open laravel debug bar

131
14:55.250 --> 14:56.410
as you can see here

132
14:56.480 --> 14:58.850
there are a lot of queries being executed.

133
14:59.150 --> 15:05.200
If you remember this is something called N+1 query problem.

134
15:05.330 --> 15:11.430
And here we can see that it came from 
app providers route service provider.

135
15:11.430 --> 15:23.200
So let's switched to our editor and open route service 
provider. And to fixed N+1 query problem we just need

136
15:23.200 --> 15:27.340
to eager load our query by adding `with` here.

137
15:32.030 --> 15:35.090
And then specify a the relation name

138
15:35.300 --> 15:35.910
So here

139
15:43.230 --> 15:50.110
we called answer user url and avatar

140
15:50.750 --> 16:02.290
that's why here we say answers user. So from question model go to answer

141
16:02.300 --> 16:03.690
model through answers

142
16:03.730 --> 16:04.810
Relationship method.

143
16:04.810 --> 16:11.510
and then from answer model go to useer model through user relationship method.

144
16:11.560 --> 16:14.180
Save all changes and let's have a look

145
16:14.200 --> 16:15.220
our queries again.

146
16:37.140 --> 16:39.870
Now our queries that executed here have been reduced

147
16:43.360 --> 16:43.700
OK

148
16:43.720 --> 16:46.330
that's it for this lesson. In the next lesson

149
16:46.360 --> 16:54.610
We're still working in here and we will be adding vote 
control in the left side of the question and answer

150
16:54.610 --> 16:56.580
item.

151
16:56.830 --> 16:57.640
All right

152
16:57.670 --> 17:00.320
here I'll save all changes to my git repo

153
17:00.470 --> 17:12.200
git add all. git commit display answers for question

154
17:16.150 --> 17:20.600
then git push origin

155
17:20.800 --> 17:23.830
lesson-15

156
17:28.890 --> 17:29.710
git

157
17:29.790 --> 17:31.380
Checkout master

158
17:35.230 --> 17:37.940
and then git merge

159
17:38.500 --> 17:40.480
lesson-15

160
17:43.360 --> 17:44.790
and last

161
17:45.020 --> 17:46.770
git push

162
17:47.390 --> 17:49.690
origin master
