00:04.430 --> 00:11.830
Alright, now let's install fontawesome 5 
and replace this text with icons.

1
00:11.830 --> 00:14.290
So let's navigate fontawesome.com

2
00:24.820 --> 00:27.940
in here when I'm recording this video

3
00:27.940 --> 00:32.130
The current version is Version 5

4
00:32.220 --> 00:41.850
point one point zero. In this version you'll find very much icons available it is about three thousand three

5
00:41.850 --> 00:46.290
hundred and thirty two icons. Though not all of them are free.

6
00:46.290 --> 00:53.080
Here we can see there are one thousand two hundred and sixty four free icons.

7
00:53.430 --> 00:59.230
And I think this is more than enough to be integrated in our application and the rest I can

8
00:59.230 --> 01:12.480
here are Pro icons. Here you'll see that one I icon has three different styles solid regular and light

9
01:13.800 --> 01:18.300
for our question answer application we will only need at least four icons.

10
01:18.300 --> 01:21.360
So let's click this All icons

11
01:26.050 --> 01:28.210
check these free option

12
01:33.560 --> 01:44.480
and firstly we'll need caret up icon for voting up the question or answer we'll need caret down icon

13
01:45.290 --> 01:56.820
for voting down the question or answer and then we'll need star icon for favoriting the question

14
01:57.590 --> 02:05.430
and last we'll need check icon for accepting the answer as best answer. Now to integrate or install font

15
02:05.430 --> 02:10.490
awesome five into your application at least there are three different options.

16
02:10.590 --> 02:17.090
First you can copy font awesome CDN link and paste into your application's view.

17
02:17.100 --> 02:18.990
Second you can download it

18
02:18.990 --> 02:25.050
put it to your public folder and reference the style sheet or a javascript file in your application's

19
02:25.050 --> 02:26.770
view. And the last

20
02:26.820 --> 02:31.700
You can install it using NPM. From these three options

21
02:31.700 --> 02:38.730
here I'll show you the last option because by using NPM we can then custom which icons that really needed

22
02:38.730 --> 02:41.340
for our application.

23
02:41.360 --> 02:47.810
This will save time when icons loaded in our page and it will make our page loading faster because we

24
02:47.810 --> 02:49.470
don't need to load all icons.

25
02:49.490 --> 02:49.830
All right

26
02:49.880 --> 02:56.420
to install font awesome 5 using NPM firstly let's open npmjs.org

27
03:01.620 --> 03:07.030
and here in the search box let's type Fortawesome

28
03:10.030 --> 03:16.450
not that here I type fortawesome instead of font awesome because if you type fontawesome

29
03:21.300 --> 03:31.210
then you will find font awesome version four point seven.

30
03:31.320 --> 03:32.610
Now if we hit return

31
03:36.730 --> 03:41.880
here we'll find some packages displayed. For this case

32
03:41.890 --> 03:43.240
we will need to install

33
03:48.560 --> 03:50.530
this font awesome core package

34
03:59.370 --> 04:04.650
and because we will use solid font awesome so here we'll also need to install this package

35
04:12.360 --> 04:14.290
so let's copy this installation command

36
04:26.170 --> 04:27.190
and paste here

37
04:37.760 --> 04:39.730
let's also copy this installation command

38
04:43.760 --> 04:46.670
and paste here. And here

39
04:46.710 --> 04:53.630
let's remove the second npm install.

40
04:53.870 --> 05:02.870
Also we need to add D flag to tell NPM that this packages as dev dependencies or dependencies that

41
05:02.930 --> 05:05.030
only required for development

42
05:08.160 --> 05:10.220
while NPM installing these packages.

43
05:10.500 --> 05:11.580
Let's go to

44
05:13.920 --> 05:22.410
resources assets and js folder and inside this folder let's create new file

45
05:26.690 --> 05:31.640
and call it fontawesome.js

46
05:34.640 --> 05:35.030
here

47
05:35.030 --> 05:39.660
firstly we need to import the font of some base package like this.

48
05:40.070 --> 05:53.490
Import fontawesome from fonrtawesome.

49
05:53.540 --> 05:57.530
Next we need to import the icons that we need. Here

50
05:57.530 --> 06:02.310
let's import font awesome caret up

51
06:05.740 --> 06:08.320
from font awesome free solid.

52
06:23.240 --> 06:23.630
OK

53
06:23.660 --> 06:32.720
let's duplicate this line then change to fa caret down

54
06:39.700 --> 06:40.570
let's duplicate again

55
06:43.860 --> 06:51.080
and then change to fa star. Duplicate one more time.

56
06:54.710 --> 06:59.280
And then change this to fa check

57
07:03.720 --> 07:10.160
Last we need to add our custom icons to font awesome library like so. Font awesome

58
07:12.570 --> 07:15.600
library and

59
07:19.730 --> 07:21.720
fa caret up

60
07:24.560 --> 07:33.720
fa caret down fa check and then fa star.

61
07:37.260 --> 07:37.580
Next

62
07:37.590 --> 07:39.760
let's open app.js

63
07:43.260 --> 07:47.030
And here let's import our font awesome dot js file like this.

64
07:52.720 --> 07:53.770
font awesome

65
07:59.010 --> 08:00.250
let's save all changes

66
08:07.150 --> 08:08.720
now here in my terminal.

67
08:08.980 --> 08:09.900
I'll open new tab

68
08:11.840 --> 08:15.060
And run npm run

69
08:15.190 --> 08:15.730
watch

70
08:18.610 --> 08:21.130
and webpack will compile javascript file

71
08:26.210 --> 08:32.420
here it say "build successful" and we can call 
our custom icons in our view.

72
08:32.420 --> 08:35.910
So let's switch to show.blade.php

73
08:40.920 --> 08:46.960
and here we can replace this text with our font awesome custom icon.

74
08:47.580 --> 09:01.000
Let's add `i` tag and then let's specify font awesome classes. In the prior persion we start with fa

75
09:01.060 --> 09:06.900
but here in front  awesome five we need to start with the font of some icon type because we are using font

76
09:07.010 --> 09:08.080
awesome solid

77
09:08.080 --> 09:20.780
So here will say `fas` and then the icon will be `fa-caret-up`.

78
09:21.350 --> 09:25.100
All right let's do almost the same thing to vote down

79
09:29.570 --> 09:45.020
replace this text and change to `fa-caret-down`.  And last let's replace this favorite with font awesome solid

80
09:46.140 --> 09:48.410
`fa-star`

81
09:51.600 --> 09:53.820
saves that and let's have a look

82
10:05.330 --> 10:08.650
here I thing this icon are too small

83
10:08.720 --> 10:17.120
So let's go back to our editor and here we can custom the icon size by specify another class

84
10:20.880 --> 10:24.230
fa and then the size

85
10:24.450 --> 10:37.370
The size could be `xs` or extra small `sm` or small `lg` or large or we can also `2x` or two times

86
10:37.730 --> 10:39.740
through ten times.

87
10:39.740 --> 10:44.450
Here I'll try `fa-2x` and I'll see how it look like

88
10:51.670 --> 10:57.820
I think it needs a bit bigger so I'll change to fa three times

89
11:03.010 --> 11:40.500
all right I think three times is enough for triangle icons.

90
11:40.720 --> 11:49.570
It's a big maybe two times.

91
11:49.830 --> 11:51.030
Okay great

92
11:51.030 --> 11:53.430
Now it's time to style our vote controls.
