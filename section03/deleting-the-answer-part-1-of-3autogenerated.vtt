00:01.830 --> 00:07.200
After we've successfully implemented create 
and update answer functionally now

1
00:07.260 --> 00:14.430
let's complete our CRUD operation in our application by implementing delete functionality for answer.

2
00:14.430 --> 00:16.710
All right let's switch over to our terminal

3
00:19.600 --> 00:20.710
and then create new branch

4
00:29.240 --> 00:30.030
OK

5
00:30.070 --> 00:31.800
Now let's open

6
00:31.810 --> 00:32.860
answers

7
00:32.920 --> 00:33.780
controller

8
00:41.420 --> 00:42.250
and here

9
00:42.330 --> 00:43.310
let's add question

10
00:43.400 --> 00:44.360
In the first argument

11
00:49.820 --> 00:54.060
note that this argument is useless in this method.

12
00:54.240 --> 00:58.340
But the reason define it is to follow the uri pattern in our routes.

13
00:58.380 --> 00:59.550
So let me show you again

14
01:12.370 --> 01:19.830
as you can see here there are two route parameters.

15
01:20.200 --> 01:20.600
OK

16
01:20.650 --> 01:21.070
here we

17
01:21.070 --> 01:28.970
authorize the user by saying this authorized delete

18
01:30.430 --> 01:31.510
answer

19
01:35.550 --> 01:42.330
And then after that we can delete the 
answer by calling answer delete

20
01:46.650 --> 02:07.320
last we can refresh the page by calling return back 
and then specify the flash message.

21
02:07.320 --> 02:13.530
Now if you remember when new answer is created the answers_count column on the questions table should

22
02:13.530 --> 02:17.350
be incremented and that's mean

23
02:17.380 --> 02:21.160
when the answer removed we need to 
decrement that column right?

24
02:21.160 --> 02:23.010
So let's open the answer model

25
02:28.320 --> 02:29.710
go to boot method

26
02:34.790 --> 02:42.470
and here we can say static double colons deleted pass a closure

27
02:49.630 --> 02:52.340
define an argument to represent the answer instance.

28
02:55.830 --> 03:13.190
And here we can decrement the answers count column 
by saying answer question decrement answers_count.

29
03:13.450 --> 03:18.860
And now I realize that this is not necesary

30
03:18.950 --> 03:21.190
so just remove it.

31
03:23.250 --> 03:23.880
All right

32
03:24.080 --> 03:25.550
save all changes.

33
03:26.630 --> 03:27.940
And let's give it a try.

34
03:31.430 --> 03:36.870
So here is the question that has been 
answered by the current user.

35
03:41.900 --> 03:48.480
And here the answers_count is three.

36
03:48.950 --> 03:50.200
Let's hit the delete button.

37
03:52.290 --> 03:53.260
Hit OK.

38
04:01.430 --> 04:07.960
The delete message show up and here the number 
of answers count has been decrement

39
04:08.170 --> 04:08.500
Great.
