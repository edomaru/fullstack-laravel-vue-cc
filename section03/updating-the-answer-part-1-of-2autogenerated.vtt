In this lesson we're gonna implement update answer functionality so that the users that has answered

1
00:07.450 --> 00:11.090
a particular question also able to edit their own answers.

2
00:13.540 --> 00:19.550
Here we need to add edit button also delete button as we did when we were building the question resource.

3
00:19.840 --> 00:26.710
And in this case I'm going to put them on the bottom left of the answer item.

4
00:26.710 --> 00:27.030
All right

5
00:27.030 --> 00:32.220
let's go ahead and open our terminal 
and create new branch by typing git

6
00:32.250 --> 00:34.310
checkout -b

7
00:34.410 --> 00:42.000
and then the branch name is lesson-18. 
OK firstly let's add button

8
00:42.040 --> 00:49.150
in our answer item. Here we can open question index.blade.php

9
00:52.990 --> 00:54.250
and simply copy

10
00:57.270 --> 01:00.770
this buttons.

11
01:00.820 --> 01:04.510
Now let's open answers _index.blade.php

12
01:10.620 --> 01:19.140
here before I paste the buttons here I'm going to restructure or make change these markup because if

13
01:19.140 --> 01:27.630
you see here the author info is too close to the right and you can see each answer item is not in

14
01:27.630 --> 01:28.510
the same line.

15
01:31.710 --> 01:37.830
Now I want to show the buttons on the left and 
the author still in the right side but it's not too

16
01:37.860 --> 01:46.490
close to the right and I want it's in the same 
line in each answer item.

17
01:46.510 --> 01:51.560
So here after answer's body I'm going to add a new div

18
01:54.330 --> 01:55.800
and give it a bootstrap row class

19
02:02.020 --> 02:02.610
inside this

20
02:02.630 --> 02:03.860
I'm going to add new div

21
02:07.960 --> 02:15.680
and give it a class col-4

22
02:15.850 --> 02:19.320
So bootstrap grid system provide 12 columns in a row.

23
02:19.570 --> 02:22.470
And here I want to split the row into three parts.

24
02:22.490 --> 02:24.910
each part will be col-4

25
02:25.180 --> 02:27.330
And inside this div just paste the buttons

26
02:31.210 --> 02:33.550
then I'm going to add another col-4

27
02:39.120 --> 02:39.540
for now

28
02:39.570 --> 02:44.200
It will be empty but maybe in the future I'm going to add something else.

29
02:47.610 --> 02:49.440
Here let's cut these lines

30
02:56.740 --> 02:58.230
and paste here

31
03:03.390 --> 03:14.860
And change this class to col-4

32
03:15.070 --> 03:18.660
All right let's change this variable

33
03:23.850 --> 03:27.700
to answer.

34
03:27.910 --> 03:36.680
And here in the edit button let's change the route 
to questions dot answers dot

35
03:36.690 --> 03:38.110
edit

36
03:38.360 --> 03:40.580
And then let's see again our edit route

37
03:57.020 --> 03:57.610
and here

38
03:57.650 --> 04:02.120
we have two route parameters so here

39
04:05.920 --> 04:08.860
we can pass in the second parameter an array.

40
04:09.220 --> 04:12.880
The first is question instance or question id

41
04:16.980 --> 04:26.120
and the second is the answer instance or answer ID.

42
04:26.470 --> 04:30.640
And here in the delete form let's change the form action

43
04:31.240 --> 04:56.790
to questions dot answers dot destroy and pass in the same array in the second parameter.

44
04:56.800 --> 04:57.390
All right

45
04:57.430 --> 05:05.860
now let's create new policy because here we call 
can update answer and can delete answer.

46
05:06.080 --> 05:15.130
Let's switch over to our terminal and generate policy for our answer model by saying: php artisan make

47
05:15.910 --> 05:20.550
policy AnswerPolicy

48
05:21.670 --> 05:25.210
model equals answer

49
05:28.900 --> 05:29.420
Now let's

50
05:29.440 --> 05:31.230
open up the answer policy file

51
05:38.240 --> 05:42.170
here get rid of the other methods except 
update and delete method.

52
05:52.940 --> 05:56.320
And here we match the current user ID with answer's user id

53
06:07.820 --> 06:09.330
let's copy this line.

54
06:12.270 --> 06:15.550
And paste here. Next

55
06:15.580 --> 06:19.420
We need to register our new policy in auth service provider.

56
06:19.420 --> 06:20.690
So let's open the file

57
06:26.380 --> 06:26.730
here

58
06:26.740 --> 06:28.930
let's import the namespace of the answer model

59
06:34.570 --> 06:45.560
and also the answer policy.

60
06:45.710 --> 06:50.660
And then here we map the answer model to answer the policy

61
07:00.320 --> 07:02.060
Alright let's save all changes.

62
07:04.540 --> 07:05.400
And have a look

63
07:15.340 --> 07:22.050
here I logged in as James Bogan

64
07:22.270 --> 07:22.900
So here

65
07:28.470 --> 07:34.040
the buttons only appear on the answer that made by this user.

66
07:34.350 --> 07:41.510
And you can see the buttons are hidden on the answers that are made by other users.

67
07:41.550 --> 07:41.970
OK

68
07:42.000 --> 07:42.870
now let's open

69
07:42.870 --> 07:43.860
Answers controller

70
07:51.080 --> 07:52.440
here in the edit method

71
07:52.790 --> 07:56.060
let's add question as the first argument.

72
08:01.780 --> 08:04.100
And here before we return edit view

73
08:04.180 --> 08:08.590
let's make sure the user that will edit the answer 
is the authorized user.

74
08:08.620 --> 08:15.420
Here we can say this authorize update

75
08:16.030 --> 08:21.070
answer.

76
08:21.180 --> 08:22.920
After that we can return

77
08:26.930 --> 08:28.840
the answers

78
08:29.230 --> 08:35.300
dot edit view and pass in the question and answer instance to it.

79
08:48.290 --> 08:54.990
Next here in update method let's also add 
question before answer.

80
09:02.490 --> 09:08.490
And inside here we also need to authorize 
the user to update the answer

81
09:21.960 --> 09:26.010
and then we can validate the answer and update it in single command like so

82
09:49.040 --> 09:57.400
remember request validate will return the array 
contains a validated data. And last after answer

83
09:57.400 --> 09:58.420
updated

84
10:03.430 --> 10:06.190
We can redirect the page to a question dot show

85
10:14.470 --> 10:18.020
and remember the questions dot show route needs a slug.

86
10:18.250 --> 10:24.710
So here we pass the question's slug.

87
10:24.880 --> 10:26.890
And let's also store a message into session.
