Before I show you how to fix this issue 
let me explain why this error happened.

1
00:06.710 --> 00:08.600
If we view our page source

2
00:12.010 --> 00:12.740
and find

3
00:16.130 --> 00:16.830
our style sheet

4
00:19.450 --> 00:28.140
As well as javascript reference here we'll see 
it's using http protocol while our production's 

5
00:28.140 --> 00:35.310
URL it is using HTTPS. So basically Heroku 
expects our style sheet and JavaScript in

6
00:35.320 --> 00:36.410
HTTPS

7
00:36.510 --> 00:38.460
So there are two options to fix this issue

8
00:44.410 --> 00:53.530
so the first option is to replace the laravel asset 
helper function in our layout with secure asset

9
00:57.480 --> 00:59.590
so let me show it to you in tinker

10
01:04.830 --> 01:05.310
here

11
01:05.320 --> 01:10.460
if we write asset css app.css

12
01:13.910 --> 01:16.570
we'll find the full URL of app.css

13
01:16.580 --> 01:23.280
with http. Now if we call secure asset

14
01:26.230 --> 01:34.440
we'll find the URL in https. So all you have to do 
is open the app.blade.php and replace all asset

15
01:34.450 --> 01:42.010
function call with secure_asset. After that you can commit 
and push your changes to Heroku and I'm sure

16
01:42.190 --> 01:43.540
all errors will be gone.

17
01:44.410 --> 01:49.480
But one thing to note if you're using this 
approach is that the https will also applied

18
01:49.570 --> 01:52.240
in development which is not ideal.

19
01:52.240 --> 01:58.150
So if you want the HTTPS will only be applied in 
production then you can use the second option.

20
02:01.900 --> 02:02.410
To do that

21
02:02.440 --> 02:04.510
let's open app

22
02:04.540 --> 02:05.650
service provider

23
02:08.970 --> 02:10.000
here in boot method

24
02:10.440 --> 02:13.760
let's add lines of code like this

25
02:14.520 --> 02:24.990
If config app dot env is equals production

26
02:31.330 --> 02:33.050
then we'll be making use

27
02:33.100 --> 02:38.830
the URLfacade and then call force scheme

28
02:42.180 --> 02:42.990
https

29
02:46.850 --> 02:53.240
so this code tells laravel that in production 
the URL will be forced to https.

30
02:53.450 --> 02:53.830
All right

31
02:53.930 --> 03:12.090
let's save the change, then commit it into our git repo

32
03:12.270 --> 03:15.450
Don't forget to push the changes to Hiroko. Here

33
03:15.450 --> 03:17.430
I can do that in this integrated terminal

34
03:17.610 --> 03:23.670
but for this purpose I prefer to use native terminal 
because it gives me overall feedback during development

35
03:23.760 --> 03:28.080
without need to scroll screen git push heroku master

36
03:38.710 --> 03:39.010
All right

37
03:39.290 --> 03:43.210
let's go back to our browser and then reload the page

38
03:46.980 --> 03:49.200
Now all errors gone

39
03:49.200 --> 03:53.130
and here our production app appears and shows us a message

40
03:53.130 --> 03:54.150
no question available.

41
04:00.090 --> 04:03.270
so let me create new account by hitting register link

42
04:15.280 --> 04:18.630
okay new account created successfully.

43
04:18.650 --> 04:20.150
Now let me create new question

44
04:23.640 --> 04:24.810
I'll enter question title

45
04:28.930 --> 04:29.620
then I'll enter

46
04:29.620 --> 04:30.400
question body

47
04:33.530 --> 04:39.440
and then I'll hit ask question button.

48
04:39.540 --> 04:40.220
Great.

49
04:40.230 --> 04:43.560
My first question created. Let me show the question

50
04:46.270 --> 04:48.340
and here I'll answer my own question

51
04:56.680 --> 05:00.480
I'll hit submit button new answer

52
05:00.480 --> 05:01.080
added here.

53
05:07.210 --> 05:08.980
Now I'll favorite this question. I'll hit

54
05:12.160 --> 05:17.780
upvotes the vote counts increasing. Last

55
05:17.930 --> 05:19.830
I'll make this answer as best answer.

56
05:23.890 --> 05:24.620
All right

57
05:24.650 --> 05:27.060
I think everything working just fine as expected.

58
05:27.770 --> 05:31.230
So congratulations your Laravel app now online.

59
05:31.280 --> 05:33.080
Be sure to show it off to your friends.
