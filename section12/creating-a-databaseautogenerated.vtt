We've pushed our code to Heroku but we get error message when we open our app in our browser. This because

1
00:09.380 --> 00:11.600
we still have a couple of things to do.

2
00:11.630 --> 00:17.870
The first one we need to create a database for our production 
app. Heroku provides different  cloud databases

3
00:18.080 --> 00:20.380
such as posgre and mysql via

4
00:20.450 --> 00:29.390
add-on. To create mysql database we need 
cleardb  mysql addon. This addon is free for

5
00:29.390 --> 00:35.950
limited 5 megabyte database size and 10 database 
connections and we also need to supply our credit card

6
00:36.110 --> 00:45.130
even if we choose free plan. If you never mind then 
you can install that addon by running this command

7
00:45.890 --> 00:56.140
heroku addon colon create cleardb colon ignite. 
Or an alternative way is to use postgre database

8
00:56.290 --> 00:58.880
via heroku-postgresql addon.

9
00:58.930 --> 01:06.580
This addon is also free and we don't need to supply 
our credit card. To do that we can say heroku addon

10
01:06.580 --> 01:10.690
colon create heroku dash postgresql

11
01:14.050 --> 01:17.680
colon hobby dash dev.

12
01:17.730 --> 01:24.690
So basically the left side is the adon's name and 
the right side is kind of a plan that we'll be using

13
01:25.860 --> 01:30.870
in this case I'll be making use this heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev.

14
01:37.300 --> 01:44.360
Alright now we have database created in the cloud.
The next thing that we need to do is to configure the

15
01:44.360 --> 01:52.740
credentials of our newly created database in our production app. Please note in the output here that

16
01:52.740 --> 02:05.350
Heroku created config variables called database URL. To
see its value we can call heroku config colon get database

17
02:05.800 --> 02:06.340
URL.

18
02:10.650 --> 02:18.570
Here we can see the full URL of our database. Now 
in Laravel application instead of database URL

19
02:18.570 --> 02:30.680
we need config variables such as db host, db port, db database, db username and db password. So how

20
02:30.680 --> 02:38.300
can we set them from this URL? Well we can 
extract the values from this database URL by

21
02:38.310 --> 02:39.240
following this form

22
02:43.570 --> 02:51.510
if you're using mysql database the URL's form will 
be similar like this. A<ll right let's set up these

23
02:51.520 --> 02:53.850
values into our new config variables.
