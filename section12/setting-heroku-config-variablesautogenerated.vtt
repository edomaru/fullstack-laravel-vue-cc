In production there's no .env file present 
because this file is not committed to

1
00:08.540 --> 00:09.270
our source code

2
00:09.280 --> 00:18.070
right? Instead here in heroku cli we can manage our 
config variables by utilizing heroku config command.

3
00:20.910 --> 00:29.380
The Heroku config:get used to show the value 
of certain config variable, and to set the config

4
00:29.380 --> 00:39.480
variable we can use heroku config:set key equals value.

5
00:39.480 --> 00:45.090
You can also set up some config variables in 
one line by separating the config var by space.

6
00:48.230 --> 00:52.580
All right, now let's set up the config 
variables for our database credential

7
00:55.810 --> 01:06.130
heroku config:set db underscore username
equals I'll copy the user name from here.

8
01:13.870 --> 01:20.440
I'll add backslash so that I can write the code in 
new line and to make the code readable. But this

9
01:20.440 --> 01:26.820
could be work only on UNIX machine. 
Then db underscore password

10
01:29.980 --> 01:35.440
equals I'll copy this long string

11
01:45.150 --> 01:45.870
and paste here

12
01:51.470 --> 01:56.700
then db underscore host equals

13
02:01.170 --> 02:02.100
I'll copy the host

14
02:10.740 --> 02:11.540
and paste here

15
02:17.130 --> 02:23.810
then db underscore port equals 5 4 3 2

16
02:27.030 --> 02:34.310
and last db underscore database equals I'll copy the database

17
02:39.800 --> 02:43.490
and paste here. Now hit return

18
02:49.980 --> 02:56.040
everything seems good. As you can see here 
the config variables that we have so far.

19
02:58.940 --> 03:06.050
Next we also need to add additional config variables. If you're using postgresql like me you need to change the

20
03:06.170 --> 03:14.130
database connection to pgsql because remember 
Laravel by default using mysql database.

21
03:17.400 --> 03:28.350
So here let's add new config variable heroku 
config:set db underscore connection equals

22
03:28.860 --> 03:29.730
pgsql

23
03:38.090 --> 03:38.600
Also

24
03:38.600 --> 03:45.590
we need to set up the config variable for our application 
key. Heroku config:set app underscore key

25
03:45.590 --> 03:52.550
equals I'll switch to my editor then copy

26
03:59.260 --> 04:01.040
and then here just paste the string.

27
04:07.100 --> 04:12.730
To show our current config variables we can write heroku config

28
04:17.930 --> 04:23.880
as you see here's the config variables that we have so far.

29
04:24.100 --> 04:29.550
OK now we can actually migrate our database 
using artisan command. Here on production

30
04:29.550 --> 04:37.500
we can write heroku run and then followed 
by artisan command php artisan

31
04:37.510 --> 04:38.100
migrate

32
04:45.750 --> 04:52.400
here we will get confirmation message. Answer yes and hit return

33
04:55.080 --> 04:56.240
whoops I get error

34
04:58.980 --> 05:04.160
here I made a mistake in database host. As you can see here

35
05:04.170 --> 05:06.030
I included this port number.

36
05:12.460 --> 05:14.800
So let me see the database URL again

37
05:24.220 --> 05:31.580
and I'll copy database host from here to here before colon.

38
05:31.860 --> 05:33.320
The port number should be excluded.

39
05:34.780 --> 05:52.620
I'll copy then I'll run heroku config:set 
db underscore host equals paste.

40
05:52.810 --> 05:59.880
Now I'll rerun the migrate command by 
saying heroku run php artisan migrate

41
06:04.820 --> 06:07.770
answer yes and hit return

42
06:14.020 --> 06:14.530
okay

43
06:14.650 --> 06:19.820
everything seems good. Now let's go 
back to our browser and reload page

44
06:25.240 --> 06:25.560
here

45
06:25.570 --> 06:34.270
our page shows up but unfortunately we'll get 
a broken page. If we open our browser console.

46
06:34.320 --> 06:40.070
Here we have other errors this requests 
have been blocked mixed content

47
06:40.190 --> 06:43.280
blah blah blah insecure script and insecure style sheet.

48
06:44.800 --> 06:47.260
Okay we'll fix this issue in the next lesson.
