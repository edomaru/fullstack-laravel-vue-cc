In this section we are going to deploy 
our Laravel application to production.

1
00:07.090 --> 00:10.870
We'll be using Heroku to share our app with the world.

2
00:10.870 --> 00:16.240
So Heroku is a cloud platform service that supports 
several different programming languages used for

3
00:16.240 --> 00:18.460
web application development model.

4
00:18.490 --> 00:24.040
Initially it's only supports Ruby programming language. 
But now it support other programming languages

5
00:24.190 --> 00:36.550
such as NodeJs, Java, PHP, Python, Go, Skala and clojure. 
We can deploy our apps in Heroku for free with

6
00:36.550 --> 00:37.950
some limitations.

7
00:38.020 --> 00:44.290
For example Heroku will slip our application after 
periods of inactivity and it will make our up a bit

8
00:44.290 --> 00:45.460
slower.

9
00:45.580 --> 00:53.850
So for professional purpose we need to upgrade to 
paid plans. Now to be able to deploy our application

10
00:53.850 --> 00:54.950
in Heroku

11
00:54.960 --> 00:59.130
firstly we need to have Heroku account. If you don't have it

12
00:59.190 --> 01:02.000
You can register by hitting this sign up button.

13
01:05.710 --> 01:14.010
just fill in the form and then hit the create free account 
button. After that you can go to your email and

14
01:14.010 --> 01:16.050
verify your Heroku account.

15
01:16.230 --> 01:22.370
Once your account verified you can 
then set your account's password.

16
01:22.380 --> 01:29.150
Secondly you need to have Heroku CLI installed 
in your machine. If you don't have it

17
01:29.170 --> 01:30.790
You can go to this link

18
01:33.660 --> 01:40.400
or you can also googling Heroku CLI and hit this link.

19
01:45.220 --> 01:54.460
in here you'll find the installer is available for Mac, 
Windows and Ubuntu. So please download the installer

20
01:54.460 --> 01:56.370
based on your operating system you have.

21
01:56.560 --> 02:02.340
Once you've installed it you can verify your Heroku 
CLI installation by opening your terminal

22
02:04.460 --> 02:06.780
and write heroku

23
02:06.910 --> 02:08.180
--version

24
02:13.230 --> 02:19.850
and here you should see heroku and Node version in the output.

25
02:19.850 --> 02:20.390
All right

26
02:20.410 --> 02:26.290
the last thing that we need to do before we manage 
our heroku apps is to log in to Heroku within this

27
02:26.290 --> 02:27.240
terminal.

28
02:27.310 --> 02:35.580
The way that we can do is by saying heroku login.
Now we need to enter our email and password

29
02:52.760 --> 02:59.400
here I get a message that indicates I have successfully 
logged in. All right now everything's set up we're

30
02:59.400 --> 03:02.220
ready to deploy our Laravel application in Heroku.
