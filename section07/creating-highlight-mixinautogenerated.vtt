In the last video we successfully solved the syntax 
highlight issue after cancel editing the question

1
00:08.400 --> 00:16.210
by replacing the v-if in the question 
component with v-show directive.

2
00:16.310 --> 00:22.970
Here we also call highlight all under method that is 
used to re-scan all code under a certain element

3
00:23.240 --> 00:25.130
and apply the syntax highlight.

4
00:25.130 --> 00:31.460
But actually we don't need to call this method in this case 
because remember v-show will keep the elements stay

5
00:31.580 --> 00:32.630
in the DOM.

6
00:32.630 --> 00:38.420
That means when the page firstly loaded the element 
will get rendered and all code inside it will get

7
00:38.420 --> 00:41.900
highlighted or presented beautifully by prism js

8
00:45.550 --> 00:47.080
so when we hit the edit button

9
00:50.120 --> 00:57.700
this element will stay in place but it only invisible 
because vue js add css display property

10
00:57.810 --> 01:07.610
to none. And then when we hit the cancel button this 
element will be visible and because there is no

11
01:07.620 --> 01:11.030
change we made the element will not need to be rendered.

12
01:11.030 --> 01:17.710
That's why calling the highlight all under 
method is completely useless in this case.

13
01:17.720 --> 01:23.960
Meanwhile after updating the question or answer because 
we possibly make any changes so that the element

14
01:23.990 --> 01:25.300
will get rendered.

15
01:25.310 --> 01:32.810
That's why we will need these lines. And in order 
to implement DRY principle we'll put these lines

16
01:32.890 --> 01:34.230
into mixins.

17
01:34.340 --> 01:45.270
All right let's cut this navigate to mixins folder. 
Now here instead of putting the previous code

18
01:45.720 --> 01:53.580
in this modification mixing we'll put it in another 
mixin. The reason why we do this is because we

19
01:53.580 --> 02:02.150
need it not only in question and answer components 
but also in New answer or answers component.

20
02:02.220 --> 02:05.680
That's why we'll put the code in separate mixin.

21
02:05.720 --> 02:07.170
Okay let's create a new file

22
02:11.860 --> 02:16.470
here I'll call it highlight dot js

23
02:20.210 --> 02:21.240
in this file

24
02:21.240 --> 02:24.140
let's add export

25
02:24.200 --> 02:29.580
default then here let's add methods property

26
02:32.890 --> 02:33.770
inside this methods

27
02:33.790 --> 02:39.160
property let's define a new method to put 
the previous code here I'll call it highlight

28
02:44.430 --> 02:46.710
and inside this method I'll paste the code

29
02:56.000 --> 03:01.210
let's also move the import statement from 
this question component into our mixin

30
03:09.700 --> 03:15.910
now we can merge one mixin to another 
one like so. I'll open the modification mixin

31
03:20.430 --> 03:21.600
import the highlight mixin

32
03:31.360 --> 03:33.340
then here let's add mixins

33
03:37.050 --> 03:42.570
and put the highlight mixin in array.

34
03:42.760 --> 03:45.010
Now we can call this method in update method

35
03:48.730 --> 03:51.810
so here we can check in with another then method

36
03:54.740 --> 04:00.780
and inside here we can call the highlight method.

37
04:00.950 --> 04:01.710
All right

38
04:01.720 --> 04:05.690
let's save all changes. Back to our browser

39
04:09.400 --> 04:10.230
reload the page

40
04:22.680 --> 04:26.570
hit the edit button.

41
04:26.650 --> 04:27.930
Here we get another issue.

42
04:28.030 --> 04:30.540
The text area no longer auto size.

43
04:30.640 --> 04:32.560
We'll fix this shortly

44
04:32.680 --> 04:34.310
for now let's hit the cancel button

45
04:36.990 --> 04:37.520
OK

46
04:37.560 --> 04:39.000
The syntax highlights still in there.

47
04:42.670 --> 04:44.690
Now I'll hit the edit button one more time

48
04:49.010 --> 04:50.650
I'll modify something here.

49
04:58.970 --> 04:59.630
Hit update.

50
05:05.570 --> 05:07.760
The syntax highlight not working.

51
05:07.760 --> 05:11.920
Let me see my code.

52
05:11.930 --> 05:13.670
Sorry I missed the parenthesis.

53
05:19.550 --> 05:20.240
reload the page.

54
05:25.240 --> 05:26.320
edit the question

55
05:29.210 --> 05:30.320
modify something here

56
05:37.600 --> 05:38.650
and then I'll update.

57
05:41.040 --> 05:41.530
Great.

58
05:41.590 --> 05:45.520
The code is still highlighting.

59
05:45.520 --> 05:49.460
Now let's fix the auto size issue.

60
06:02.480 --> 06:04.850
Let's often the M editor component

61
06:11.100 --> 06:13.240
here because the parent component

62
06:13.260 --> 06:17.550
in this case Question.vue will not re-rendered 
when we hit the edit button. Here

63
06:17.610 --> 06:21.860
we don't need this mounted hook anymore. So let's remove

64
06:21.870 --> 06:22.590
these lines

65
06:29.890 --> 06:30.820
reload the page.

66
06:36.840 --> 06:40.750
Hit the edit button. OK

67
06:40.770 --> 06:43.150
Now the auto size still working great.

68
06:47.960 --> 06:56.300
In the next video we'll be implementing this mechanism 
in this answer component. So let's commit all

69
06:56.320 --> 06:57.910
changes to our git repo.
