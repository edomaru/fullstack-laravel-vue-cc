We've successfully integrated syntax highlight to make 
our code beautiful in our markdown preview. But it's

1
00:07.680 --> 00:11.760
not work in here or maybe in other places.

2
00:11.760 --> 00:17.470
So before we fix this issue we need to realize 
that we have two different markdown parser

3
00:17.580 --> 00:21.060
What we see here is parsed by markdown in server side

4
00:24.800 --> 00:29.960
while here is parsed by markdown it partner in the client side.

5
00:29.990 --> 00:31.910
Now let's see our code in the preview tab

6
00:38.440 --> 00:45.070
so in order to make the syntax highlight really working 
we need to have our code wrapped inside `pre` and

7
00:45.070 --> 00:58.440
code tag and we should also have the programming 
language specified in these class attributes

8
00:58.620 --> 00:59.640
Now if you see here

9
01:02.740 --> 01:10.940
our code is wrapped in p tag. So now you know that 
the problem could be in body html in our model.

10
01:11.050 --> 01:16.380
So let's go to our editor then open our question model

11
01:24.410 --> 01:30.020
let's jump to body html attribute.

12
01:30.020 --> 01:36.370
Here you see that we have passed 
the body html in this clean method.

13
01:36.370 --> 01:42.940
This method basically used to protect our html code 
from malicious code or xss attack by removing

14
01:43.030 --> 01:47.480
all vulnerable tags including script pre and code tags.

15
01:47.620 --> 01:54.080
So all we have to do is to white list the pre 
and code tags so that they will be ignored.

16
01:54.160 --> 02:00.910
Remember that this clean method is come from purifier  
package and this package provides configuration

17
02:00.910 --> 02:03.260
file that we can customize.

18
02:03.340 --> 02:05.680
So let's now open the config

19
02:08.430 --> 02:09.990
purifier dot php

20
02:18.070 --> 02:24.120
in this file we need to specify what html 
tag to be allowed in this html dot allowed

21
02:28.340 --> 02:29.170
so here

22
02:29.170 --> 02:32.880
let's define the pre and code tags

23
02:35.710 --> 02:45.670
and let's also specify the class attribute 
so that purifier will also ignore their class.

24
02:45.860 --> 02:47.110
That's it.

25
02:47.150 --> 02:48.440
Now if we save the change

26
02:54.530 --> 02:55.420
and reload the page

27
03:01.530 --> 03:03.090
now it's work as we expect

28
03:07.630 --> 03:08.270
and I think

29
03:08.350 --> 03:09.610
everything should be fine now.

30
03:11.690 --> 03:25.840
Let me edit one more time to make sure 
that everything working good. I'll hit

31
03:26.070 --> 03:26.700
update button

32
03:32.310 --> 03:33.790
here we have another issue.

33
03:33.880 --> 03:42.240
The syntax highlight is gone after I made change. If 
I reload the page the syntax highlight is come back.

34
03:42.310 --> 03:44.920
Do you have any idea why this happening?

35
03:44.920 --> 03:46.750
Let's fix this issue in the next video.
