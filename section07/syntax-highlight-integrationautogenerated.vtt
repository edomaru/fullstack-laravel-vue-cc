In this video we're going to integrate syntax highlight
to our app so that all code that we write will

1
00:06.530 --> 00:07.820
be presented beautifully.

2
00:08.690 --> 00:12.740
So there are many plugins out there 
that we can choose the most popular

3
00:12.770 --> 00:22.890
are highlight js and prims js. Both plugins has pros 
and cons but in this lesson we'll be making use

4
00:23.070 --> 00:32.570
this prims js. Prims js provides some beautiful 
themes as you can see here is default theme.

5
00:32.880 --> 00:36.330
And if I don't like it you can choose other theme such as

6
00:40.090 --> 00:40.750
Twilight

7
00:43.260 --> 00:48.920
coy solarized light tomorrow light etc.

8
00:50.800 --> 00:54.590
And here we can see several websites that already used prims js.

9
00:54.760 --> 00:58.180
That means this package is mature and reliable.

10
00:58.270 --> 01:04.480
Also the reason why I chose this package is because 
we've already integrated markdown it package into our

11
01:04.480 --> 01:12.370
app and as I mentioned before that package provides 
some plugins include prism js integration. so let's

12
01:12.370 --> 01:14.830
navigate to npm js dot com

13
01:19.550 --> 01:20.740
then here

14
01:20.880 --> 01:25.240
let's find markdown it prism

15
01:30.100 --> 01:30.490
here

16
01:31.060 --> 01:32.170
let's hit this package

17
01:36.900 --> 01:38.730
and copy the npm install command

18
01:42.990 --> 01:49.090
please note that by installing this package the 
prism js core package will also get installed.

19
01:49.090 --> 01:49.450
Okay

20
01:49.530 --> 01:51.030
let's go to our terminal

21
01:54.830 --> 01:59.120
and before we moving on let's create 
a new branch to isolate our work git

22
01:59.180 --> 02:04.690
checkout -b lesson-45

23
02:07.750 --> 02:09.810
okay paste the command here.

24
02:10.240 --> 02:14.190
And don't forget to add -D flag. Hit return

25
02:17.500 --> 02:17.940
now

26
02:17.950 --> 02:21.910
while it's installing let's open m editor dot vue

27
02:30.570 --> 02:35.340
then after importing markdown it package 
let's import the markdown it prism here.

28
02:45.760 --> 02:52.090
And then use it or integrate it with mark
down it by saying md dot use prism

29
02:58.080 --> 02:58.310
now

30
02:58.320 --> 03:05.140
as I mentioned earlier the prism js provides some themes 
and we need to apply one of them in our app. If 

31
03:05.170 --> 03:07.440
we navigate to node modules

32
03:10.160 --> 03:12.440
then find prism js

33
03:20.170 --> 03:24.330
here it has themes folder and inside it we will find some themes.

34
03:28.450 --> 03:30.730
So the way that we can do is to load

35
03:30.730 --> 03:33.610
one css file inside our component like this

36
03:43.690 --> 03:44.190
that's it.

37
03:44.290 --> 03:46.600
web pack will take care of this for us.

38
03:46.600 --> 03:52.660
But the problem is by doing this way whenever we want 
to switch to another theme we need to change the

39
03:52.660 --> 04:01.380
them name here and then recompile the code. So an alternative way it's a copy all these theme to a public

40
04:01.380 --> 04:09.010
directory and then we can reference the theme in 
our layout. We can do that manually or by defining a

41
04:09.010 --> 04:16.250
command in webpack mix js

42
04:16.350 --> 04:17.760
Here we can duplicate this line

43
04:21.320 --> 04:27.820
then change it to copy which also accepts two arguments.

44
04:27.950 --> 04:35.470
The first one is a file or directory that we will copy 
in this case the themes directory inside node

45
04:35.470 --> 04:37.030
modules prism js

46
04:40.720 --> 04:46.560
and a second one is a target or a new 
location where it will be placed. In my case 

47
04:46.570 --> 04:52.750
I'll store it in public css prism js themes.

48
04:57.870 --> 04:58.350
All right

49
04:58.420 --> 04:59.330
let's save all changes

50
05:06.300 --> 05:07.820
and if we have web pack running

51
05:08.010 --> 05:09.990
You need to restart it to apply the changes

52
05:16.050 --> 05:17.790
when it's finished

53
05:17.790 --> 05:19.410
we'll find in

54
05:22.160 --> 05:26.870
this public css directory a new folder

55
05:32.560 --> 05:36.240
so let's open our layout app.blade.php

56
05:40.430 --> 05:41.390
then here

57
05:41.390 --> 05:46.340
right after loading the app dot css 
let's then load the prism js themes.

58
05:49.720 --> 05:50.400
Let's save

59
05:54.450 --> 05:56.190
now if we reload the page

60
06:00.420 --> 06:01.440
then edit the question

61
06:04.450 --> 06:05.640
and then hit the preview tab

62
06:08.760 --> 06:11.070
you'll see the syntax has been highlighted

63
06:14.580 --> 06:18.270
if I go back to write tab and add another code

64
06:22.200 --> 06:27.330
here I'll be adding css code and I'll copy the css code from prims

65
06:27.350 --> 06:27.760
js

66
06:37.050 --> 06:40.400
paste here.

67
06:40.520 --> 06:49.930
Now if I hit the preview tab as you can see whatever  
the code we write here presented beautifully.

68
06:49.930 --> 06:52.510
Okay great.

69
06:52.510 --> 06:59.960
I'll hit update to save the changes to database.

70
07:00.180 --> 07:06.180
Now if you see here our code is broken 
and the syntax highlight is not working.

71
07:06.180 --> 07:08.650
I hope you get idea why this is happening.

72
07:08.670 --> 07:13.160
But if we don't we'll fix this issue in the next video.

73
07:13.180 --> 07:15.710
All right let's go commit our changes to our git repo.
