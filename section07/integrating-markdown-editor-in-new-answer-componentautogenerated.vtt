00:01.560 --> 00:08.500
After we've successfully integrated markdown editor and 
syntax highlight in both question and answer component

1
00:08.550 --> 00:16.460
the next thing that we need to do is to implement 
them in this new answer component. So let's switch

2
00:16.460 --> 00:19.890
back over to our editor.

3
00:20.130 --> 00:28.720
here I'll run npm run watch

4
00:28.880 --> 00:31.270
then let's open new answer component.

5
00:38.100 --> 00:39.900
Here in script section

6
00:39.900 --> 00:42.440
let's import the M Editor component

7
00:55.130 --> 01:05.640
then register it in components property

8
01:05.670 --> 01:09.300
now we can jump to our template and find the text area.

9
01:12.210 --> 01:15.690
Here let's wrap it with m editor

10
01:18.550 --> 01:20.680
bind the body to body

11
01:24.500 --> 01:30.220
also name equals new dash answer

12
01:39.590 --> 01:43.260
that's all we need to add markdow editor in this component.

13
01:43.280 --> 01:50.650
Now let's highlight the code that possibly written in New 
answer. As you can see here when the form submitted

14
01:51.100 --> 01:56.550
its we'll call create method so let's jump to this create method

15
02:02.920 --> 02:08.930
in this method we perform from AJAX call and 
when succeed it's emitting created event to the

16
02:08.930 --> 02:09.800
parent component.

17
02:13.510 --> 02:15.360
So let's open

18
02:15.590 --> 02:16.730
the answers component

19
02:20.790 --> 02:23.080
find the new answer component

20
02:26.630 --> 02:33.100
here we'll find on created it's called add method.

21
02:33.130 --> 02:35.740
Now let's go to add method as you

22
02:38.610 --> 02:47.570
can see here in this method we push our new answer to 
answers array and then increment the answer counter

23
02:50.960 --> 02:56.210
so here we can call this dot highlight to highlight our new answer

24
03:01.390 --> 03:03.670
and don't forget to import the highlight mixin

25
03:16.660 --> 03:24.620
and add it in mixins property.

26
03:24.640 --> 03:25.060
That's it

27
03:25.770 --> 03:27.010
now let's save all changes

28
03:30.790 --> 03:38.580
back to our browser reload the page.

29
03:38.720 --> 03:44.500
All right now we have markdown editor 
in our new answer component.

30
03:44.740 --> 03:45.960
Let me write something here

31
03:57.810 --> 04:03.290
let me preview this answer here the script is highlighted.

32
04:03.510 --> 04:04.720
Now I'll save this answer

33
04:08.070 --> 04:15.000
new answer added but unfortunately the code is not highlighted.

34
04:15.010 --> 04:16.650
Let me switch back to my editor

35
04:19.620 --> 04:21.480
I'll open the highlight mixin

36
04:24.890 --> 04:27.080
then here I'll console log the element

37
04:34.020 --> 04:34.680
I'll save

38
04:38.890 --> 04:39.550
reload the page

39
04:48.280 --> 04:52.260
let me edit this I'll copy

40
04:57.400 --> 05:01.540
then paste here and chance a little bit.

41
05:06.920 --> 05:08.450
I'll open my browser console

42
05:12.840 --> 05:13.560
and I'll hit submit

43
05:19.250 --> 05:20.920
here in my console

44
05:20.990 --> 05:22.820
the element is undefined.

45
05:22.890 --> 05:27.290
