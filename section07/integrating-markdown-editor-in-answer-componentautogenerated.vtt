00:01.370 --> 00:07.700
In this video we're going to apply our markdown editor 
in our answer component. To do that let's switch back

1
00:07.850 --> 00:13.820
over to our editor. Here I'll run web pack by saying npm run watch

2
00:17.270 --> 00:19.150
OK let's open answer component

3
00:22.630 --> 00:23.120
here

4
00:23.160 --> 00:29.580
we're going to do almost the same thing 
as we did in question component. So here

5
00:29.590 --> 00:33.760
let's replace the v-if with v-show

6
00:48.840 --> 00:49.380
then here

7
00:49.470 --> 00:56.550
let's also replace the v-else with v-show not editing

8
01:03.510 --> 01:04.510
now here

9
01:04.590 --> 01:07.680
let's import the M Editor component

10
01:12.860 --> 01:15.050
then register in components property

11
01:22.700 --> 01:29.230
and then find the text area in our template. Here it is

12
01:32.830 --> 01:35.320
and wrap it in m Editor component like this

13
01:43.460 --> 01:48.080
now it we save the change then switch our browser

14
01:53.300 --> 01:55.000
I need to find my own answer

15
02:14.240 --> 02:14.640
here

16
02:14.680 --> 02:15.470
I'll edit my answer

17
02:18.700 --> 02:19.640
hit the preview tab

18
02:25.590 --> 02:28.130
unfortunately it's not work.

19
02:28.140 --> 02:36.400
So why this happen do you have any idea? 
Well if you open the M Editor component

20
02:41.710 --> 02:50.060
here you'll see that both element using id attribute 
to control the behavior. When we include the

21
02:50.060 --> 02:54.680
M Editor in other places then there will be duplicate ids here.

22
02:55.340 --> 02:59.870
So to fix this issue we need to distinguish these ids

23
02:59.870 --> 03:00.650
also here

24
03:04.010 --> 03:06.290
so let's jump to answer

25
03:11.550 --> 03:12.090
then here

26
03:12.100 --> 03:19.050
let's specify our custom attribute for example name equals answer

27
03:23.230 --> 03:34.600
or to avoid conflict naming let's bind 
the name attribute to unique name.

28
03:34.630 --> 03:37.770
Now let's jump to computed property

29
03:47.730 --> 03:50.160
and here let's define the unique name

30
03:54.160 --> 04:03.460
return answer this dot id. This will produce a string like this

31
04:10.360 --> 04:17.740
Let's copy this method definition then switch to question dot vue

32
04:20.890 --> 04:33.120
jump to computed property then paste the 
method here and change the string to question.

33
04:33.120 --> 04:34.100
Find the editor

34
04:40.040 --> 04:40.460
and here

35
04:40.480 --> 04:46.940
let's also bind the name attribute to unique name.

36
04:47.130 --> 04:57.430
Next we can go back to m editor dot vue. 
Here in script section let's add in props

37
04:57.600 --> 04:57.990
the name

38
05:10.980 --> 05:12.630
then inside the methods property

39
05:16.570 --> 05:19.800
here let's define a new method basically

40
05:19.800 --> 05:25.980
this method will concatenate the tab name with the 
name that we specify in the parent component through 

41
05:26.070 --> 05:27.110
name property.

42
05:27.240 --> 05:28.690
You can name it whatever you like

43
05:28.800 --> 05:38.080
in my case I'll call it tab id. It receives two 
arguments the first one is the tab name

44
05:41.460 --> 05:44.560
and the second one is a hash which is empty by default

45
05:50.640 --> 05:52.100
then inside this method

46
05:52.110 --> 05:58.430
we simply return a string which compose the hash

47
06:02.100 --> 06:02.800
tab name

48
06:06.840 --> 06:14.780
and the name.

49
06:14.820 --> 06:16.430
Now we can jump to our template

50
06:20.090 --> 06:23.150
then here let's bind this href attribute

51
06:30.350 --> 06:33.350
to tab id write

52
06:42.010 --> 06:43.150
also here

53
06:43.160 --> 06:48.550
let's bind the href attribute to tab id

54
06:52.000 --> 06:52.600
preview

55
06:56.110 --> 06:56.620
hash

56
06:59.890 --> 07:04.450
and then let's bind the id of this tab pain to

57
07:07.680 --> 07:11.030
tab id write

58
07:18.030 --> 07:20.100
and bind the second tab pain to

59
07:23.250 --> 07:23.970
tab id

60
07:27.450 --> 07:30.730
preview. Let's save all changes

61
07:34.940 --> 07:35.870
back to our browser

62
07:41.090 --> 07:42.030
reload the page

63
07:47.280 --> 07:51.490
let me edit the question hit the preview tab

64
07:53.250 --> 07:53.930
OK

65
07:54.200 --> 08:02.530
It's working as we expected.

66
08:02.580 --> 08:03.780
Let me edit this question

67
08:13.420 --> 08:15.330
hit the preview tab

68
08:15.430 --> 08:19.560
All right now the preview tab in answer 
component also working great.

69
08:25.270 --> 08:25.540
Let's hit

70
08:25.550 --> 08:25.940
Update

71
08:30.160 --> 08:32.470
the syntax highlight not working.

72
08:32.520 --> 08:33.150
Let me see

73
08:40.830 --> 08:42.260
OK here

74
08:42.330 --> 08:46.280
We need to define this ref in our answer component

75
08:51.610 --> 08:53.380
so here I'll define

76
08:56.050 --> 08:58.540
ref body html. Save

77
09:04.870 --> 09:05.740
reload the page.

78
09:11.400 --> 09:12.420
I'll edit one more time

79
09:22.550 --> 09:23.520
hit update.

80
09:25.360 --> 09:30.280
OK it's working. Now before we end this video

81
09:30.280 --> 09:31.270
let's do one more thing

82
09:34.880 --> 09:42.220
if you realize both answer and question components they

83
09:42.380 --> 09:44.120
depends on m editor

84
09:47.910 --> 09:49.920
end user info components.

85
09:49.920 --> 09:57.770
In my opinion it would be better to put this import statement 
as well as this components property inside

86
09:57.770 --> 10:00.960
our mixin so that it will make our code more lean

87
10:03.650 --> 10:05.690
so let's cut this import statements.

88
10:10.680 --> 10:13.620
In answer component we can remove these

89
10:17.000 --> 10:19.010
switch to a modification mixin

90
10:22.620 --> 10:26.970
and paste on the top. And here

91
10:27.050 --> 10:28.630
let's change the components path

92
10:41.790 --> 10:43.110
back to question component

93
10:47.280 --> 10:49.230
let's cut this components property

94
10:55.830 --> 10:59.220
switch to answer component and remove this line

95
11:05.710 --> 11:10.630
back to modification mixin and paste inside here.

96
11:14.390 --> 11:15.410
Le'ts save all changes

97
11:20.200 --> 11:23.080
and let's make sure our latest change not breaking our app

98
11:48.260 --> 11:53.460
okay so far so good. Let's commit our changes into our git repo.
