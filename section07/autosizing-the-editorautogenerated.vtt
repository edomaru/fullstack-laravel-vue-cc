In this video we're going to make this text area to 
automatically resize its height based on the text

1
00:07.430 --> 00:13.970
that contains inside it so that we can see entire body 
of the question without need to scroll up or down

2
00:13.970 --> 00:14.860
the text area.

3
00:15.860 --> 00:16.230
All right

4
00:16.320 --> 00:19.560
firstly let's navigate to this URL.

5
00:27.710 --> 00:28.010
Here

6
00:28.010 --> 00:30.140
let's copy the Installation Command

7
00:35.570 --> 00:36.860
switch to our terminal.

8
00:40.840 --> 00:41.170
Here

9
00:41.180 --> 00:44.060
I'll run web pack by saying npm run watch

10
00:54.420 --> 01:01.260
and then here I'll paste the command and then I'll 
be adding -D to indicate that this package is dev

11
01:01.250 --> 01:10.510
dependency or dependency that required for development 
only. Now let's go to M Editor component.

12
01:10.590 --> 01:11.950
Go to script section

13
01:15.220 --> 01:16.400
and here

14
01:16.610 --> 01:31.830
firstly let's import the auto size package.

15
01:31.880 --> 01:43.210
Here we can make the text area to auto size by utilizing 
this auto size function and specify the element.

16
01:43.220 --> 01:47.900
Now the question is where we should 
call the auto size in this component.

17
01:47.900 --> 01:53.250
Do you have any idea? In my opinion 
there are two possible ways.

18
01:53.250 --> 02:00.070
The first one is a call it in watcher so watcher is 
vue js feature that allows us to do something

19
02:00.250 --> 02:02.080
whenever a particular property changes

20
02:06.070 --> 02:09.660
so here we can add watch option

21
02:18.560 --> 02:19.660
than here

22
02:19.680 --> 02:25.440
when the body changes you want to do something 
we can do so by adding here the body data property

23
02:26.170 --> 02:27.330
that they want to watch over

24
02:35.060 --> 02:36.800
and here we can console log a message

25
02:46.920 --> 02:50.760
now and the second way is to utilize the updated life cycle hook.

26
02:55.110 --> 02:59.550
This hook executed after data changes 
in our component and a DOM re-render

27
03:02.240 --> 03:04.200
so here let's also console log a message.

28
03:12.530 --> 03:13.200
All right

29
03:13.230 --> 03:14.030
let's save all changes

30
03:17.300 --> 03:18.230
back to our browser

31
03:22.780 --> 03:28.480
reload the page.

32
03:28.620 --> 03:30.600
Now let's open our browser console.

33
03:37.460 --> 03:38.450
then hit the edit button.

34
03:46.730 --> 03:56.370
Now if we make any update here you can see the console 
the watch body and updated hook messages appear.

35
03:56.440 --> 03:59.450
So basically each option has similar behavior.

36
03:59.530 --> 04:04.150
Every time we made change the body watcher 
and updated hook will get triggered.

37
04:04.420 --> 04:07.960
So let's switch back over to our editor

38
04:10.720 --> 04:14.850
and from these options it's up to 
you to choose which one you prefer.

39
04:14.950 --> 04:17.290
In my case I'll be using the updated hook

40
04:23.140 --> 04:23.960
so here

41
04:24.050 --> 04:35.130
Let's replace this line with auto size and pass the 
text area in. We can do that by saying document

42
04:36.360 --> 04:37.770
dot query selector

43
04:42.330 --> 04:43.050
text area

44
04:47.280 --> 04:50.010
or we can also use the vue js way like so

45
04:57.340 --> 05:00.250
and here I'll remove this watch option

46
05:07.760 --> 05:08.180
okay

47
05:08.230 --> 05:12.290
let's save. Back to our browser

48
05:17.370 --> 05:18.070
reload the page

49
05:21.580 --> 05:22.390
hit the edit button

50
05:28.040 --> 05:30.920
here the height of the text area is not changing.

51
05:32.400 --> 05:38.230
But when I make change here now it's has full height.

52
05:38.230 --> 05:40.210
Actually this is not what we want.

53
05:40.230 --> 05:44.030
We wanted the full height as soon as we hit the edit button.

54
05:44.310 --> 05:47.920
Maybe we need to call the auto size in mounted hook.

55
05:47.940 --> 05:51.900
Let's go back to our editor here

56
05:51.910 --> 05:53.080
let's add mounted

57
05:57.600 --> 05:58.410
copy this line

58
06:02.940 --> 06:09.920
and paste here. Let's save back to our browser reload the page

59
06:13.210 --> 06:14.390
and hit again the edit button

60
06:18.660 --> 06:19.610
as you can see

61
06:19.710 --> 06:22.170
Now our text area has full height.

62
06:22.230 --> 06:26.100
We can see entire body question 
without need to scroll the text area.

63
06:30.280 --> 06:30.560
now

64
06:30.570 --> 06:32.680
If you type something hit return

65
06:36.370 --> 06:45.510
no scroll needed hear and I anything this much better.

66
06:45.630 --> 06:47.910
I think that's all we need for this lesson.

67
06:47.940 --> 06:49.920
Let's commit our changes to our git repo.
