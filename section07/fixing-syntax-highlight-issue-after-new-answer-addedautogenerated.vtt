00:01.450 --> 00:08.000
After a couple of minutes searching I finally realized 
that ref will not work with reactive data binding

1
00:08.110 --> 00:11.350
as noted in this vue js api here.

2
00:11.500 --> 00:14.860
So here we need to find other alternatives.

3
00:14.860 --> 00:21.430
Maybe the easiest way is to call highlight all 
under method to re-scan all DOM elements.

4
00:21.430 --> 00:28.240
But again I don't want to choose that way because in 
my opinion re scanning all DOM to highlight our code

5
00:28.450 --> 00:31.950
after a new enter added is not make sense.

6
00:32.020 --> 00:33.870
Maybe we can use the classic way

7
00:34.510 --> 00:41.650
I mean we'll be making use the id tribute to the element 
then select the element with the javascript get

8
00:41.680 --> 00:42.980
element by id method.

9
00:43.240 --> 00:44.370
So let's do that

10
00:44.980 --> 00:47.590
let's switch over to our editor.

11
00:47.650 --> 00:55.130
Don't forget to run npm run watch 
then open the answer component.

12
01:03.410 --> 01:03.890
Here

13
01:03.990 --> 01:14.870
lets bind the attributes to unique name. Remember unique name will generate a string contains answer

14
01:14.870 --> 01:17.240
and id of the answer. Next

15
01:17.360 --> 01:21.360
let's jump to highlight mixin. Here

16
01:21.380 --> 01:25.470
let's modify this highlight method definition again.

17
01:25.520 --> 01:31.970
First let's define an argument let's say 
id and it should be empty by default

18
01:34.700 --> 01:35.030
here

19
01:35.060 --> 01:35.960
Let's cut this

20
01:40.520 --> 01:43.630
then here if the id is empty

21
01:47.890 --> 02:00.430
we'll assigned to el variable from this refs body 
html. Otherwise if id is not empty we'll select

22
02:00.430 --> 02:08.290
the element by utilizing the document dot get element by id

23
02:11.320 --> 02:13.380
and pass in the id from argument.

24
02:16.480 --> 02:16.990
That's it

25
02:18.070 --> 02:24.520
So basically what we did here is to make this highlight 
method to be more flexible. When we call this

26
02:24.520 --> 02:26.560
method without passing id

27
02:26.740 --> 02:35.620
this method will select element by ref or reference. 
And when we need to select element by id we need

28
02:35.620 --> 02:40.300
to call this highlight method add passing the id.

29
02:40.400 --> 02:42.950
Now let's go back to answers component

30
02:49.140 --> 02:50.700
then here in highlight

31
02:50.700 --> 02:56.390
method call let's specify the id as answer

32
02:59.560 --> 03:00.610
answer dot id.

33
03:04.890 --> 03:06.010
Le'ts save all changes

34
03:09.850 --> 03:13.720
back to our browser I get error

35
03:20.410 --> 03:23.350
let me change this to `let` save

36
03:27.330 --> 03:30.180
back to our browser reload the page

37
03:32.910 --> 03:34.630
let's open our browser console

38
03:37.970 --> 03:39.440
again I'll copy this answer

39
03:45.020 --> 03:46.010
and then paste here

40
03:56.650 --> 03:57.240
I'll hit submit

41
04:00.440 --> 04:01.670
here in console.

42
04:01.670 --> 04:06.350
I get null and the syntax highlight

43
04:06.380 --> 04:08.070
still not working.

44
04:08.090 --> 04:09.980
Do you have any idea why this happened?

45
04:14.810 --> 04:22.400
So this occurred because vue js performs DOM updates 
asynchronously so I can simply say that when

46
04:22.400 --> 04:29.780
we perform ajax call and get respond back the new answer object then pushed to the answers array because

47
04:29.780 --> 04:30.530
the answers array

48
04:30.540 --> 04:35.260
is reactive vue js will will perform DOM updates asynchronously.

49
04:35.570 --> 04:39.140
But before it's finished this highlight method is being called

50
04:43.080 --> 04:49.530
so in order to wait until vue js has finished updating 
the DOM we can use the vue js next tick

51
04:49.530 --> 04:50.310
method like this

52
04:57.920 --> 05:01.820
then move the highlight method call inside here

53
05:05.740 --> 05:06.400
let's save

54
05:09.590 --> 05:10.250
reload the page

55
05:16.710 --> 05:18.060
again I'll copy this answer

56
05:25.410 --> 05:26.130
and paste here

57
05:30.940 --> 05:32.020
let's hit the submit button

58
05:35.340 --> 05:36.420
okay great.

59
05:36.450 --> 05:38.760
Here we see the element appears in the console

60
05:43.030 --> 05:47.360
and our new answer is being highlighted. Now

61
05:47.400 --> 05:53.670
the last more thing that we need to do is here the 
load more answer button. Here if we hit the button

62
05:55.210 --> 05:57.640
some answers will be added to the page

63
05:57.820 --> 06:01.820
but here you see the code is not highlighted.

64
06:01.870 --> 06:07.240
Also I found another issue sometimes if I reload the page

65
06:11.890 --> 06:19.210
here you'll see the syntax highlight is not working. 
So we'll fix these issues in the next video.

66
06:19.210 --> 06:19.690
All right

67
06:19.750 --> 06:21.940
let's commit our changes into our git repo.
