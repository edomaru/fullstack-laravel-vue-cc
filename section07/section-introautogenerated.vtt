Up until this point we write our posts our questions or 
answers in a text area without knowing how they

1
00:08.550 --> 00:12.060
will look before we actually submit them.

2
00:12.100 --> 00:17.830
I think it would be better to have a feature that 
allows us to see how our post will look like before

3
00:17.830 --> 00:19.750
we save them into database.

4
00:19.750 --> 00:24.730
This will make writing the post much easier 
and make our app look more professional.

5
00:24.760 --> 00:28.750
So in this section we're going to build this kind of feature.

6
00:28.750 --> 00:30.940
If it can't get the picture let's see in GitHub

7
00:40.090 --> 00:43.600
so here you can write something in mardown syntax.

8
00:43.600 --> 00:50.490
Then you can hit the preview tab to see how 
it look like if you think your post look good

9
00:50.490 --> 00:56.070
You can then hit the submit button to persist your 
post or if you think there's something wrong with

10
00:56.070 --> 01:01.890
your post then you can simply switch 
back to write tab and continue editing.

11
01:01.890 --> 01:06.060
So we're going to build this markdown editor but in much simpler.

12
01:08.870 --> 01:10.980
And to make out app more interesting

13
01:11.000 --> 01:16.430
we're also going to implement syntax highlight so that 
all code that we write in our app will be presented

14
01:16.430 --> 01:16.990
beautifully.

15
01:21.360 --> 01:26.580
So this section can be contains two parts and each 
part will be isolated into two different working

16
01:26.630 --> 01:28.470
branches. In the first one

17
01:28.500 --> 01:35.220
we're going to create the editor component or how we 
compose some components such as tabs cards and

18
01:35.220 --> 01:43.140
so on to produce text box along with the mardown 
preview. Then in the second one we will be implementing

19
01:43.380 --> 01:47.760
the syntax highlight for code formatting in our page.

20
01:47.760 --> 01:48.930
OK let's get started.
