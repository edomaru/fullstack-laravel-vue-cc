In order to make the markdown preview functional 
we will need to installed market parser package. So

1
00:09.170 --> 00:11.570
let's navigate to npm

2
00:11.610 --> 00:12.150
js dot com

3
00:18.630 --> 00:20.310
here in the search box

4
00:20.340 --> 00:24.320
Let's find markdown parser

5
00:28.240 --> 00:28.960
in this list

6
00:29.180 --> 00:38.440
let's choose this markdown it because this package 
although less popular with this mark package but

7
00:38.450 --> 00:45.110
it's good in quality and maintenance also

8
00:45.170 --> 00:52.840
this package provides some plugins that will extend 
the functionality of the package such as markdown

9
00:53.190 --> 00:55.700
emoji markdown it container

10
00:59.280 --> 01:03.810
markdown it footer and so on.

11
01:03.940 --> 01:06.270
All right let's hit this package

12
01:10.830 --> 01:11.180
here

13
01:11.190 --> 01:12.870
let's copy the installation command

14
01:17.720 --> 01:19.130
let's switch to our terminal

15
01:22.450 --> 01:25.820
and here I'll run run watch

16
01:29.360 --> 01:41.390
open new terminal and paste the previous command
here. And let's add dash dash save dev to indicate

17
01:41.450 --> 01:49.750
that this package is dev dependencies or we can 
simply use the shorthand just like this. Hit return

18
01:54.240 --> 01:54.650
now

19
01:54.670 --> 02:04.950
while it's install let's switch to to 
m editor dot vue. Go to script here

20
02:05.080 --> 02:07.500
firstly let's import the markdown it package.

21
02:21.930 --> 02:34.800
Then define a variable to hold the markdown it instance.

22
02:34.810 --> 02:36.510
Now we can add computed property

23
02:44.570 --> 02:46.790
and here let's define a new method.

24
02:47.140 --> 02:49.030
I'll call it preview.

25
02:53.190 --> 03:03.850
Inside this method we can render the raw markdown 
into html by saying return md dot render

26
03:06.270 --> 03:11.830
and then pass the body in.

27
03:12.030 --> 03:13.520
Now we can go to our template

28
03:18.650 --> 03:22.700
and here we can add html content to this div by saying 

29
03:26.000 --> 03:27.140
v html

30
03:29.990 --> 03:33.290
equals preview

31
03:38.270 --> 03:40.180
and we don't need this text anymore.

32
03:45.690 --> 03:45.950
Alright

33
03:46.340 --> 03:48.750
let's save and have a look.

34
03:58.260 --> 03:58.940
Reload the page

35
04:04.700 --> 04:15.050
hit the edit button and hit the preview tab. As you 
can see now we can preview our question here.

36
04:15.120 --> 04:17.040
So if I write something here

37
04:37.110 --> 04:42.540
here I can see how it look before I actually 
save the change into database.

38
04:42.600 --> 04:45.300
Okay great

39
04:45.300 --> 04:51.240
Now one thing we need to fix here 
is this text area because if we see

40
05:03.390 --> 05:04.040
when I hit the edit

41
05:04.050 --> 05:13.450
button the rest of the question is hidden and I need to 
scroll up or down to see entire body of the question

42
05:15.280 --> 05:16.160
in my opinion

43
05:16.210 --> 05:21.850
It would be better to make the height of this text 
area to automatically resize depends on the text

44
05:21.940 --> 05:23.090
that contains inside it.

45
05:24.310 --> 05:26.020
So we'll do that in the next video.
