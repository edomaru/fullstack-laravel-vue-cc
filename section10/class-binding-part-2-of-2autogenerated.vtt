00:02.400 --> 00:11.060
Let's open the class bindings one dot html. 
Here we have a box in cyan color if we inspect

1
00:11.070 --> 00:14.820
element

2
00:15.000 --> 00:24.000
It has bootstrap class bg info. What we'll do here is 
change the class to bg primary when user mouse

3
00:24.000 --> 00:25.230
over to the box.

4
00:30.620 --> 00:37.080
Otherwise if the user mouse out from the box
the background color will turn back to bg info.

5
00:37.480 --> 00:39.080
OK let's do that.

6
00:40.810 --> 00:48.970
Let's switch back over to our editor then open 
the class bindings one dot html file. In the books

7
00:49.020 --> 00:50.330
There are two classes

8
00:52.840 --> 00:54.760
row and bg info

9
00:55.090 --> 01:00.370
Here we're going to leave the row class on the country

10
01:00.540 --> 01:04.080
let's cut the bg-info class then let's add

11
01:07.260 --> 01:12.870
v-bind colon class equals then here

12
01:13.980 --> 01:21.890
we'll pass an object as an argument but before that we 
should remember we'll need two different classes here.

13
01:21.910 --> 01:28.480
One class will be applied when mouse 
over and another class when most out.

14
01:28.750 --> 01:34.110
So before we define that class we can 
firstly define in the data property

15
01:38.490 --> 01:43.570
a property to hold the state whether 
the user is hovering mouse or not.

16
01:43.930 --> 01:50.710
Let's say hovered and it should be false by default.

17
01:55.230 --> 02:00.110
Then we can change its value on mouse over

18
02:04.320 --> 02:13.360
and on mouse out. Then we can change its 
value on mouse over event and on mouse out.

19
02:13.380 --> 02:21.000
So here we just replace the hovered's value to true.
And on mouse out we change the hovered's value

20
02:21.030 --> 02:27.610
back to false.

21
02:27.630 --> 02:30.940
Now we can define the classes in the object argument.

22
02:34.560 --> 02:41.800
The first one is bg info. This class will be 
applied when hovered property is false.

23
02:45.540 --> 02:53.330
Then the bg primary will be applied when hovered is true.

24
02:53.340 --> 02:54.340
Now let's have a look

25
02:57.010 --> 02:57.770
actually

26
02:57.880 --> 02:58.970
let me clean this up.

27
03:14.220 --> 03:15.000
As you can see

28
03:15.120 --> 03:20.040
now the background color has turn 
to blue or applied bg primary class.

29
03:20.040 --> 03:20.780
In this case.

30
03:31.650 --> 03:38.230
But unfortunately when mouse out 
the color doesn't change. Let me see.

31
03:38.370 --> 03:42.310
Sorry I made a typo it should be hovered

32
03:42.330 --> 03:46.810
So it should be matches with the property that we defined here.

33
03:46.950 --> 03:47.460
Save

34
03:52.370 --> 03:57.950
now here the class still bg info and if I now hover over the box

35
03:57.950 --> 04:02.820
the background color turns to bg primary. If I mouse out of the box

36
04:04.200 --> 04:06.470
It's now back to bg info.

37
04:10.550 --> 04:11.060
Next

38
04:11.090 --> 04:16.120
let's open the class bindings two dot html.

39
04:16.240 --> 04:17.570
Here we have the exact same app.

40
04:17.590 --> 04:20.950
We'll change the background color to bg primary

41
04:21.130 --> 04:27.370
when we mouse over the box and change back the 
background color to bg info when mouse out the box.

42
04:27.520 --> 04:31.020
But the difference here we will define the class in array.

43
04:37.080 --> 04:38.510
Let's copy everything

44
04:40.240 --> 04:46.990
then pasted it in the class bindings two dot html. 
Because all we need to do here is changing the class

45
04:46.990 --> 04:48.060
banding.

46
04:48.130 --> 04:57.280
So as I mentioned before to apply classes in array 
we just define the class name as array element.

47
04:57.730 --> 05:05.280
But here we need to check the state of the hovered 
property to determine a single class. If it was true

48
05:05.620 --> 05:10.900
then the class will be bg info otherwise bg primary.

49
05:11.430 --> 05:17.120
So let's change this as array opening and closing

50
05:23.710 --> 05:25.570
then inside it we can check

51
05:29.160 --> 05:34.640
if hovered is true

52
05:34.740 --> 05:40.050
then the class will be bg primary.

53
05:40.310 --> 05:47.330
Otherwise the classes will be bg info.

54
05:47.350 --> 05:53.100
I don't think we need to change other part so let's save that.

55
05:53.300 --> 05:57.550
Now if you try to hover over the box 
the background color changes.

56
05:57.740 --> 06:04.990
if we mouse out the box the background color back to 
original color. So the result here is exactly the same but

57
06:04.990 --> 06:07.390
the difference here we defined the classes

58
06:07.550 --> 06:08.290
in array.

59
06:08.660 --> 06:13.150
Alright now let's try to define a 
single class in a string. Let's open

60
06:13.150 --> 06:16.950
class binding 3 dot html

61
06:17.020 --> 06:19.670
Here we have an alert primary.

62
06:19.810 --> 06:24.800
if we select the class here

63
06:24.960 --> 06:28.100
then the alert style should be change.

64
06:28.180 --> 06:35.200
For example if we choose the secondary option then 
the alert here will turn to alert secondary and

65
06:35.200 --> 06:36.100
so on.

66
06:37.040 --> 06:38.690
Let's switch back over to our editor.

67
06:41.610 --> 06:49.120
Here we have alert alert primary. So the class 
that we need to make dynamic is alert primary.

68
06:49.120 --> 06:54.250
It depends on what we choose in select option. Let's cut

69
06:58.060 --> 06:59.750
then add here bind class

70
07:04.330 --> 07:07.460
here because we only need to apply a single class

71
07:07.810 --> 07:16.710
We can pass it as a string. Now since we need to 
take the value from select option then apply it here

72
07:17.240 --> 07:27.060
so before that let's firstly define it in the data 
property for example alert type and give it

73
07:27.060 --> 07:32.780
a default value as alert primary.

74
07:32.790 --> 07:36.030
Now we can pass into our class binding the alert type.

75
07:41.290 --> 07:42.640
Let's save.

76
07:43.100 --> 07:46.340
Then back to our browser.

77
07:47.000 --> 07:48.610
OK so far so good.

78
07:48.620 --> 07:54.340
The last thing that we need to do here is to make use 
input binding from the select element to the alert

79
07:54.540 --> 07:55.420
type.

80
07:55.490 --> 08:00.370
Here we can simply use v-model then alert type.

81
08:04.370 --> 08:08.160
save. Let's have a look

82
08:13.030 --> 08:21.050
I'll choose the secondary option. The alert turns to the 
secondary. Now I'll choose other option success,

83
08:21.250 --> 08:25.340
danger, warning.

84
08:26.220 --> 08:28.700
OK that's about class binding.
