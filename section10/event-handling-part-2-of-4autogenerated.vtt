We can also make use of the object events to the events 
we listen to to get more information about the event.

1
00:10.700 --> 00:16.650
For example when we move the mouse we want to know 
the coordinate information where the mouse is moved

2
00:16.680 --> 00:17.810
on the page.

3
00:18.730 --> 00:23.230
Or when we type something in the textbook we 
want to display the value again somewhere.

4
00:24.480 --> 00:26.570
Let's open the event handling two dot

5
00:26.600 --> 00:27.090
html

6
00:34.910 --> 00:38.910
here we have one big box that say's mouse over here.

7
00:38.960 --> 00:44.070
Below that you'll find a description of x zero and y zero.

8
00:44.190 --> 00:50.270
Later we will make use the event object to display 
coordinate values in real time when we mouse over

9
00:50.270 --> 00:52.820
this area.

10
00:52.900 --> 01:00.240
Let's go back to our editor then open 
the event handler two dot html file.

11
01:00.480 --> 01:01.560
Here we can see

12
01:04.900 --> 01:13.310
that inside the data property we defined x 0 
and y 0. We will change the value of both

13
01:13.520 --> 01:17.540
when we hover over the mouse inside the div which has id box

14
01:23.800 --> 01:33.650
let's add in the box v-on colon mouse move 
and then call get coordinates method

15
01:33.700 --> 01:38.960
for example. Then in vue option we can define methods property

16
01:44.990 --> 01:47.240
and then declare the get coordinates method in it.

17
01:51.530 --> 01:57.650
by default vue js will pass the object event 
in every method call in v-on directive.

18
01:57.650 --> 02:05.160
So here we can explicitly define an argument 
in get coordinates let's say event.

19
02:05.400 --> 02:07.590
Then inside the method we just assign

20
02:11.360 --> 02:17.860
event dot client x or x coordinate to the x property

21
02:25.040 --> 02:30.890
and assign the event dot client y or 
y coordinates in the y property save.

22
02:35.090 --> 02:35.630
Now if we

23
02:35.650 --> 02:43.240
however over our mouse or the blue box the value of 
x and y will change in real time every time we move

24
02:43.240 --> 02:43.950
the mouse.
