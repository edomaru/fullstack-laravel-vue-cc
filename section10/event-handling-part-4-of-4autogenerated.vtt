When listening for keyboard events we often need to 
check which key that pressed by a user on the keyboard

1
00:08.300 --> 00:16.520
to determine which code to be executed. Vue js allows 
us to add a modifier to the v-on directive specifically

2
00:16.550 --> 00:17.110
for the keyboard

3
00:17.200 --> 00:25.020
event. Because this modifier is specifically for 
keyboard event it is better known as key modifier.

4
00:25.140 --> 00:31.270
Let's open the event handling four dot html.

5
00:31.360 --> 00:32.990
If we look at this application

6
00:33.020 --> 00:34.830
It's similar to the previous one.

7
00:34.840 --> 00:40.530
The difference here is that at the bottom 
there is only one input without a button.

8
00:41.530 --> 00:47.700
Later when we type something and then press the 
enter key it will immediately be added to the list.

9
00:49.680 --> 00:54.930
or when we press the escape key, what 
we type in the text box will be reset.

10
00:56.690 --> 01:07.030
Let's switch over to our editor then open 
the event handling four dot html file.

11
01:07.190 --> 01:10.160
If you see the text box is in a div element

12
01:12.880 --> 01:17.310
so to make it able to add something 
that we type in the text box to the list

13
01:17.560 --> 01:19.300
when a user press enter

14
01:19.510 --> 01:20.720
we can define here

15
01:23.290 --> 01:27.890
v-on colon key up

16
01:28.060 --> 01:32.560
then we add a modifier 13 which is the key code of the enter key.

17
01:33.780 --> 01:37.220
Then we call the handle submit method.

18
01:39.760 --> 01:45.640
So if you want to handle keyboard event of certain keys 
besides the enter key then you need to know the

19
01:45.640 --> 01:49.010
key code. To do that

20
01:49.020 --> 01:53.190
You can go to key code dot info

21
01:56.770 --> 02:01.600
in here you can find out the key code of 
any key that you press on the keyboard.

22
02:09.090 --> 02:10.080
Beside that

23
02:10.150 --> 02:21.200
vue js also provides an alias for the enter key so he 
can change this 13 to enter. Here in handle submit

24
02:21.200 --> 02:26.930
method

25
02:27.060 --> 02:40.880
we can assure that the user has type something before actually add it to the list. If this framework trim or if the framework name

26
02:40.880 --> 02:45.150
entered in the text box is not empty then move this lines.

27
02:45.210 --> 02:45.830
inside the if

28
02:49.150 --> 02:51.800
let's save and switch back over to our browser.

29
02:58.040 --> 02:59.080
Try to enter something

30
03:03.460 --> 03:11.440
we'll see new framework on the list when we press the enter key.

31
03:11.440 --> 03:15.100
Now let's add another modifier to the input to do something else

32
03:15.100 --> 03:18.350
when we press the escape key.

33
03:18.520 --> 03:19.870
Let's go back to our editor

34
03:23.450 --> 03:24.460
and inside

35
03:27.390 --> 03:32.970
the input we can add another v-on keyup

36
03:35.740 --> 03:42.580
and then specify dot esc modifier that is modifier for escape key.

37
03:43.000 --> 03:48.760
Then let's call clear text method for 
example. In this methods property

38
03:53.460 --> 03:54.950
let's define the clear text method

39
03:59.950 --> 04:05.250
and inside this method let's clear the framework property's value.

40
04:13.650 --> 04:15.990
Now if you tried to type something in the text box

41
04:19.770 --> 04:25.330
and then press the escape key everything 
inside the text box will be reset immediately.

42
04:26.810 --> 04:34.580
Now beside enter and esc alias modifier vue js 
also provides other aliases such as tab, delete

43
04:34.790 --> 04:42.260
capture both delete and bask space 
keys, space, up, down, left and right.

44
04:43.490 --> 04:43.990
Alright

45
04:44.120 --> 04:46.340
that's about event handling in vue js.
