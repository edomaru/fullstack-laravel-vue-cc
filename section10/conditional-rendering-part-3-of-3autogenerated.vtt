Now before we end this lesson I'm going to show you another 
directive to show or hide the element. The directive

1
00:10.560 --> 00:18.390
is v show. This v show directive it's almost the same 
as the v-if which is displaying the element if the

2
00:18.390 --> 00:23.940
condition that is passed is true or hiding 
the element if the condition is false.

3
00:25.100 --> 00:27.610
So what's the difference between these two.

4
00:27.620 --> 00:29.000
Now to answer this question

5
00:32.770 --> 00:35.870
let's open the conditional rendering four dot html

6
00:41.470 --> 00:49.550
here we have two alerts and two buttons. We will show 
or hide each alert if we click on each of these buttons

7
00:49.760 --> 00:54.240
and we'll see the difference in how 
each element is rendered in the page.

8
00:54.250 --> 00:59.310
Let's switch back over to our editor then
open conditional rendering four dot html

9
01:06.830 --> 01:10.970
inside this data property there are two properties

10
01:11.200 --> 01:20.400
show alert  primary and show alert secondary and both 
of them are true. Now in this alert primary let's define

11
01:20.520 --> 01:21.190
v if

12
01:24.200 --> 01:25.270
show alert primary

13
01:29.340 --> 01:36.520
and then on the alert secondary let's 
define v show show alert secondary.

14
01:39.900 --> 01:43.590
Now let's chance its property when 
we click on each of these buttons

15
01:48.020 --> 01:51.160
here we can call v-on colon click

16
01:55.990 --> 02:03.110
then here we will replace it's value with 
the inverse value show alert primary

17
02:06.640 --> 02:20.820
equals not show alert primary. Then here we can 
change the second button to show alert secondary.

18
02:20.830 --> 02:21.460
Now let's see

19
02:26.290 --> 02:27.400
something wrong.

20
02:30.570 --> 02:32.530
Sorry I forgot to add equals here.

21
02:34.350 --> 02:37.330
Save that. OK

22
02:37.350 --> 02:38.760
before we move on

23
02:38.940 --> 02:40.740
let's open our web developer tools

24
02:44.720 --> 02:50.710
then here I will put the window on the right side so 
that I can see how each element will be rendered.

25
02:54.650 --> 02:55.940
I'll hit the v-if button.

26
02:58.560 --> 03:01.750
Now here we can see the elements are gone.

27
03:01.770 --> 03:03.510
So it's completely removed.

28
03:03.900 --> 03:06.420
Now I'll hit the button.

29
03:06.510 --> 03:08.670
Now we can see the elements still there.

30
03:09.030 --> 03:12.590
But here it's hidden by adding css display property

31
03:12.600 --> 03:19.970
if I hit again one more time the display property 
will be removed from the element but the v-if

32
03:22.110 --> 03:25.980
the element will be added to the page or remove from the page.

33
03:25.980 --> 03:30.850
So that's the difference between v-if and 
we v-show in manipulating the elements.

34
03:30.870 --> 03:35.340
So in general there is no significant 
difference between v-if and v-show.

35
03:35.430 --> 03:38.020
Now you might be asking when do we use v-if

36
03:38.190 --> 03:42.790
and when do we use the v-show. To find the answer

37
03:42.790 --> 03:46.220
you can check out the vue js official documentation here.

38
03:51.280 --> 03:52.370
OK that's it.

39
03:52.390 --> 03:53.680
I'll see you in the next lesson.
