00:02.760 --> 00:05.200
Next let's make use of the v-for directive

1
00:05.300 --> 00:06.000
to array.

2
00:08.370 --> 00:11.630
Let's open the list rendering two dot html

3
00:14.730 --> 00:15.960
And in here

4
00:16.160 --> 00:19.710
we will display a list contains top 10 frameworks

5
00:20.690 --> 00:24.600
Let's switch over to our editor.

6
00:24.780 --> 00:27.780
Then let's open up list rendering two dot html

7
00:31.050 --> 00:32.740
and then we can jump to our script

8
00:37.260 --> 00:38.650
here in data property

9
00:38.700 --> 00:45.840
we have top ten frameworks  property and it has 
an array of string contains names of the framework.

10
00:45.840 --> 00:51.260
This is only a sample data which taken 
from the hot framework dot com website.

11
00:51.390 --> 00:55.540
I don't know for sure whether this data is really valid or not.

12
00:55.540 --> 01:02.520
Anyway let's show the frameworks 
name in here to this unordered list.

13
01:02.970 --> 01:06.480
So let's get rid of some list items and leave one item

14
01:10.990 --> 01:21.160
here in the list item we can say the v-for equals and 
then in the left side for the alias name let's called it

15
01:22.140 --> 01:25.830
framework in top ten frameworks.

16
01:30.290 --> 01:35.000
And then let's change the text to framework.

17
01:40.670 --> 01:46.730
Now here we can see top ten frameworks that we defined 
in vue instance are listed in this page by making

18
01:46.730 --> 01:49.890
use the v for directive.

19
01:49.980 --> 01:53.160
Now in some cases we may need to access the index array. To do

20
01:55.890 --> 02:04.870
that we can use the v-for in a form like this v-for item 
comma index in items where index is the index

21
02:04.870 --> 02:10.140
number of array element which will be iterated. Alright

22
02:10.140 --> 02:12.500
let's open the list rendering three dot

23
02:12.690 --> 02:18.670
html and here we will display a list 
of the top ten framework as before.

24
02:21.110 --> 02:26.140
The difference here we also need to show 
the score on the right side of each list item.

25
02:28.920 --> 02:30.880
So let's switch back over to our editor

26
02:34.190 --> 02:35.330
than open up

27
02:35.400 --> 02:40.820
list rendering three dot html.

28
02:41.020 --> 02:43.870
And then let's jump to the script section

29
02:47.670 --> 02:55.250
here in data property we have a new property scores 
which contains array of numbers. So for the score it

30
02:55.290 --> 02:59.230
will be look like ASP.NET

31
02:59.380 --> 03:05.310
One hundred angular js ninety six and so on.

32
03:05.360 --> 03:11.520
Now we can go to our unordered list and 
remove all list items except the first one

33
03:18.330 --> 03:22.960
and then here we can say v-for equals parenthesis

34
03:26.170 --> 03:33.490
framework coma index  in or let's use of for

35
03:33.490 --> 03:40.070
now and then top ten frameworks.

36
03:40.110 --> 03:58.030
Now before we show the score in here let's 
show the index after the framework name.

37
03:58.160 --> 04:03.020
Here we can see the index array on the 
right side of the framework name.

38
04:03.020 --> 04:18.060
Now it's time to show the score by utilizing this index.

39
04:18.130 --> 04:25.630
Here we can say score and then specify the index like so.

40
04:27.590 --> 04:29.360
Save let's see

41
04:49.090 --> 04:52.590
OK we have successfully displayed 
the top 10 frameworks in the list

42
04:52.660 --> 04:57.170
and their score respectively by making use index in v-for directive.
