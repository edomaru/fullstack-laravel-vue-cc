What we handling an event we can also modify the event we listen. For example when we're handling the submit event

1
00:09.630 --> 00:17.180
on the form because the default action of the form 
is to directly send data to the server then maybe

2
00:17.180 --> 00:22.250
you want to stop it and instead make 
AJAX call to send the request.

3
00:22.320 --> 00:28.280
In this case we usually make use of the event dot prevent 
default in the event handling method that we define.

4
00:28.860 --> 00:34.980
But it would be better if the method is purely about 
data logic rather than having to deal with DOM

5
00:34.980 --> 00:37.830
event details. For that we can use

6
00:37.940 --> 00:46.580
event modifier in the v-on directive. Note that the 
modifier is called after directive and is denoted

7
00:46.670 --> 00:48.970
by a dot.

8
00:49.150 --> 00:51.290
Let's open the event handling three dot

9
00:51.350 --> 00:51.830
html.

10
00:55.460 --> 01:06.200
Here we have a form with an input and a submit button. 
If we try to click the submit button it will display an alert.

11
01:06.200 --> 01:07.520
After we hit the OK button

12
01:08.890 --> 01:11.180
It then will be send to the server.

13
01:12.210 --> 01:18.380
Now let's go back to our editor then open 
the event handling three dot html file.

14
01:21.710 --> 01:28.300
In the form we can see an event handling for the 
submit event which is call the handle submit method

15
01:33.510 --> 01:41.070
then the handle submit method we call javascript 
alert. Now let's modify the v-on submit

16
01:45.320 --> 01:51.660
by adding dot prevent modifier.

17
01:51.810 --> 01:54.690
Let's save that

18
01:54.830 --> 02:04.670
Now if we hit the submit button again the alert show up 
but the default action that is send data directly to server

19
02:05.030 --> 02:05.900
will be stopped.

20
02:07.510 --> 02:09.010
So now in the handle submit

21
02:11.880 --> 02:20.530
we can remove the alert and instead let's add a new 
framework that we might enter in the text box into

22
02:20.530 --> 02:21.970
the favorite framework property.

23
02:43.920 --> 02:54.480
After that we can reset the value of framework property  
this dot framework equals empty. Then let's define

24
02:54.690 --> 03:01.610
the framework in the data property.

25
03:01.670 --> 03:16.340
And finally let's bind the framework property into our input form.

26
03:16.360 --> 03:18.160
Now let's go back to our browser

27
03:21.580 --> 03:26.690
and then try to enter any framework 
name then hit the submit button.

28
03:30.320 --> 03:35.000
as you can see the framework name that we answered 
in the text box will be immediately added to the

29
03:35.000 --> 03:36.120
list.

30
03:36.290 --> 03:42.050
And because we defined the event handler to the submit 
event we can also be able to type any framework name

31
03:44.340 --> 03:49.580
then press enter key to directly add it to the list.

32
03:49.680 --> 03:59.620
Now besides prevent vue js also provides other modifiers 
such as stop, capture, self, ones and passive.

33
04:00.020 --> 04:04.550
