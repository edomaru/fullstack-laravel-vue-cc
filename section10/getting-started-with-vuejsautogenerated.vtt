Vue js is progressive javascript framework 
for building user interfaces.

1
00:07.060 --> 00:14.790
It is simple lightweight flexible and very performance
while still providing a lot of features and option

2
00:14.790 --> 00:18.950
tools that can help us build a modern web application efficiently.

3
00:19.260 --> 00:24.490
In this section we will met the library and after 
a brief interaction we will start creating our

4
00:24.510 --> 00:33.060
first vue js application. Vue js focus on a view layer its 
core library focus mainly on view layer of the application

5
00:33.480 --> 00:39.620
and it's also perfectly capable to build 
a single page application or SPA

6
00:39.980 --> 00:46.530
Vue js is progressive framework that means vue js 
is design from the ground up to be incrementally

7
00:46.530 --> 00:53.040
adaptable with a core library focused on user interfaces 
that you can use in existing projects to make

8
00:53.040 --> 00:55.200
your application more interactive.

9
00:55.380 --> 01:02.950
You can make from the small app all the way up 
to the large and sophisticated web applications.

10
01:03.200 --> 01:09.960
Vue js relative newcomer in the javascript frontend landscape but now it's very popular javascript frontend framework and widely

11
01:09.960 --> 01:18.540
used across the world for web development. Why vue js? 
Getting up and running with the vue js is quite simple.

12
01:18.540 --> 01:24.210
You don't need to use a module bundler like web pack 
because the core library doesn't have any dependency.

13
01:24.300 --> 01:30.780
Just include the vue js core the library from cdn 
into your page and you're ready to get started.

14
01:31.530 --> 01:37.510
If you know HTML and Javascript reasonably well 
you'll find that vue js has a low learning curve

15
01:37.710 --> 01:40.710
it shouldn't take you long at all.

16
01:40.950 --> 01:46.990
The vue documentation is so detail easy to understand 
and includes various code examples.

17
01:47.070 --> 01:49.950
All right there's a brief introduction about vue js

18
01:50.130 --> 01:53.300
let's finally start and build our first vue js application.

19
01:54.790 --> 01:57.870
Firstly let's open the vue js official homepage.

20
01:57.920 --> 02:03.450
vue js dot org and here we can hit this get this get started button 

21
02:03.890 --> 02:06.170
And this will take us to vue js guide.

22
02:07.760 --> 02:10.980
Here let's navigate to installation menu

23
02:18.070 --> 02:22.250
and then here we'll got a couple of 
different options how to install vue js

24
02:22.300 --> 02:26.640
For now let's use the simplest one which is using cdn.

25
02:26.790 --> 02:34.100
Here you can grab this script or you can also copy the latest version of vue js url from

26
02:34.110 --> 02:35.310
js deliver cdn

27
02:39.440 --> 02:44.780
here you can also copy the url from unpackage or cdn js.

28
02:50.260 --> 02:50.660
Here

29
02:50.710 --> 02:53.740
I also open online editor called js fiddle.

30
02:53.830 --> 02:56.160
You can access it in js fiddle dot net

31
02:59.380 --> 03:03.050
So this editor is web editor where we can play around with

32
03:03.250 --> 03:11.410
HTML css and javascript and we can also see the 
output in one page. Here in HTML section let's

33
03:12.630 --> 03:17.720
type script colon src then hit tab

34
03:17.820 --> 03:22.470
paste the URL and remove the forward slash in the end.

35
03:27.500 --> 03:33.200
And with that we include the vue js and we can 
now use it and build our first vue js application.

36
03:35.990 --> 03:41.640
Here let's add a div and give id attribute 
app or whatever name you like.

37
03:45.320 --> 03:50.210
And then here in javascript section we 
need to instanciate a new vue instance.

38
03:50.210 --> 03:59.770
We can do that by saying new vue. This instance has one 
major job control the HTML code which then render to

39
03:59.900 --> 04:01.330
the screen.

40
04:01.590 --> 04:07.370
Now in order to let the vue instance do that we 
have to pass in an option object as an argument.

41
04:09.620 --> 04:15.920
This object is central in vue and define and control 
data and behavior. It contains all the information

42
04:16.130 --> 04:19.020
needed to create vue instance and components.

43
04:19.100 --> 04:27.880
For now let's specify el property which accepts 
a selector or an element as an argument.

44
04:27.910 --> 04:38.510
Here we can say hash tag app which will return 
the element in the page with app as the identifier

45
04:38.510 --> 04:44.210
With that everything that we will write inside the 
div with the id as app will be under controlled by

46
04:44.210 --> 04:49.990
this vue instance. And with under control I 
mean we can then change it or manipulate it

47
04:50.030 --> 04:51.200
through this vue instance.

48
04:56.690 --> 04:59.810
So here in this div let's add a heading 1

49
05:02.820 --> 05:08.030
and then here let's make javascript expression 
and output the result to the heading. Here

50
05:08.050 --> 05:15.560
vue js have special syntax to output something double 
curly braches opening and closing and in-between

51
05:15.760 --> 05:24.700
I'll write Hello plus world

52
05:24.800 --> 05:31.740
This is normal way to declare a literal string in javascript 
here we just concatenate two strings and display the result.

53
05:34.390 --> 05:35.890
So if we hit the run button

54
05:39.080 --> 05:41.900
here in the output we'll have Hello world message

55
05:50.060 --> 05:50.520
now

56
05:50.630 --> 06:00.030
vue js also has special property called data which 
accepts object. Here we store all data that we want

57
06:00.030 --> 06:02.040
to use in this vue instance.

58
06:02.170 --> 06:04.040
Here I'll define message

59
06:06.950 --> 06:09.310
and I'll cut this message

60
06:12.860 --> 06:14.000
and paste in this message

61
06:14.020 --> 06:14.510
property.

62
06:17.820 --> 06:21.130
Here I can call the message like this

63
06:24.970 --> 06:32.480
here we only need to call message and vue js will look 
into this data object find the message property and

64
06:32.480 --> 06:34.760
parse it in HTML code.

65
06:36.090 --> 06:37.430
If we now hit the run button

66
06:40.670 --> 06:48.560
we will get the same thing. Now if I change the message to hello

67
06:48.610 --> 06:52.570
vue js and then hit the run button again

68
06:56.990 --> 07:01.140
you can see it reflect the chance there. Alright

69
07:01.170 --> 07:07.220
we've completed our first step into vue js world and 
are now able to build a simple vue js application.

70
07:08.100 --> 07:11.280
In the next lesson I'm going to show you how the set up vue js locally.
