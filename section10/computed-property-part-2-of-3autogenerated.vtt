00:02.810 --> 00:05.660
Let's open the computed property one dot html.

1
00:08.280 --> 00:16.660
And here we have three form elements a title selection, 
name and email inputs. And below that we have

2
00:16.660 --> 00:23.200
an alert showing the title and name in uppercase and lowercase.

3
00:23.200 --> 00:32.700
Now here if we change the title we cannot see any 
changes in the alert but once we update the name

4
00:37.380 --> 00:39.220
the changes reflected in it.

5
00:41.610 --> 00:46.390
So let's go to our editor and then open computed property one

6
00:46.450 --> 00:53.110
dot html

7
00:53.190 --> 00:55.870
And here we can see each form element

8
00:55.890 --> 01:08.530
is bound to variable using v model directive. Then in
an alert we have two paragraphs each contains title

9
01:09.250 --> 01:19.610
concatenate with name converted to uppercase and 
lowercase. Although this only simple logic but we need

10
01:19.610 --> 01:26.250
to consider that our view or our templates should 
only be concerned with displaying data to the user.

11
01:27.090 --> 01:29.130
That's why we will move them into vue

12
01:29.130 --> 01:31.220
option.

13
01:31.380 --> 01:39.710
So let's jump to the script section and here we 
can see that the title is outside the vue instance

14
01:39.730 --> 01:41.460
That's why it was not reactive

15
01:44.900 --> 01:46.940
now let's add methods property.

16
01:53.380 --> 01:56.100
And inside that we can define a method

17
01:56.370 --> 01:58.500
let's say upper name

18
02:03.740 --> 02:06.150
then let's move this expression

19
02:11.190 --> 02:13.570
inside the upper named method

20
02:18.370 --> 02:19.880
add return in the beginning

21
02:24.700 --> 02:27.000
the title is outside the vue instance

22
02:27.130 --> 02:29.180
So we don't need to make any changes.

23
02:30.810 --> 02:39.290
But here the name is in data property.

24
02:39.390 --> 02:45.400
Inside the vue option scope we need 
to call it by explicitly add 'this'.

25
02:45.690 --> 02:56.160
So this dot name. Hear in the template we can 
now call the method upper name parentheses.

26
02:56.310 --> 02:56.760
All right

27
02:56.790 --> 03:07.730
Let's also move this expression but now we will place 
it in computed property. Back to script section and here

28
03:07.730 --> 03:13.020
in vue option let's add computed property

29
03:13.220 --> 03:16.220
and in this property let's define a method

30
03:16.610 --> 03:18.850
I'm going to call it lower name

31
03:21.610 --> 03:30.470
inside this method let's add return then paste the code.

32
03:30.620 --> 03:32.810
Don't forget to add this before the name

33
03:36.050 --> 03:37.530
here in the template

34
03:38.880 --> 03:45.980
we can now call our method or function that we defined 
in computed property just like the lower name.

35
03:46.170 --> 03:53.460
We don't need parentheses and vue js will automatically 
invokes the function. Now before we run this

36
03:53.650 --> 03:58.510
let's also add console log in both upper name and lower name

37
04:21.420 --> 04:31.530
and here let me add computed to distinguish the 
method call. Let's save switch back to our browser.

38
04:31.670 --> 04:32.690
Let's open console

39
04:37.180 --> 04:37.630
and here

40
04:37.660 --> 04:41.890
Let me put it on the right so that I can see the log.

41
04:45.160 --> 04:50.840
Here we can see upper name and computed 
lower name called on the first load.

42
04:50.890 --> 04:52.150
Now let's select the title

43
04:55.240 --> 05:01.500
and here we don't see any changes 
on the alert as well as in the console.

44
05:01.560 --> 05:04.660
The title is not reactive variable

45
05:04.730 --> 05:10.900
that's why it will not trigger an update on the view.

46
05:10.950 --> 05:12.450
But now if we update the name

47
05:16.400 --> 05:22.790
the title in the computed property instantly change 
this because changing the name will trigger an

48
05:22.790 --> 05:28.760
update for the computed property.

49
05:28.860 --> 05:34.040
And here we also see the upper name 
and computed lower name being called

50
05:34.100 --> 05:43.750
every time I hit the key.

51
05:43.890 --> 05:46.010
Now what if we update the email

52
05:58.860 --> 06:05.220
as you can see in the console only upper name method 
being called this because the variable email is reactive

53
06:06.120 --> 06:08.630
and it will trigger the view to be refreshed.

54
06:10.440 --> 06:13.490
Because in the template we call upper name

55
06:13.790 --> 06:20.220
that's why this method will be called. The computed 
lower name it's not called because as I said the

56
06:20.220 --> 06:26.600
value is cached so that the function will not rerun as 
long as the dependent property is not updated.

57
06:26.610 --> 06:28.900
I hope you get the idea.
