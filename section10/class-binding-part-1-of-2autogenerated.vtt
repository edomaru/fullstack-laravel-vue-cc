00:01.610 --> 00:08.520
In the previous lesson we have learned how to display 
or hide elements conditionally by using v-if 

1
00:08.520 --> 00:11.370
v-else or v-show directive.

2
00:11.370 --> 00:17.460
Now another common thing that we might encounter in 
modern web development is adding or removing classes

3
00:17.580 --> 00:26.290
in certain elements. If you might have used jQuery then 
you can do that by making use the add class method

4
00:26.530 --> 00:32.800
to add classes to certain elements or remove class 
method to remove classes from certain elements.

5
00:32.800 --> 00:33.430
In this lesson

6
00:33.430 --> 00:39.760
we're going to learn how to do this stuff in vue js.
So in vue js we can make use of a technique

7
00:39.790 --> 00:41.820
called class binding.

8
00:41.830 --> 00:48.610
So class binding is a mechanism for dynamically applying 
one or several classes to a particular element.

9
00:49.830 --> 00:59.120
We can use the v-bind colon class directive followed by 
argument. Or we can simply write colon class equal

10
00:59.280 --> 01:01.930
argument. The argument itself

11
01:02.080 --> 01:09.820
can be an object, array or string. If you want to apply 
it conditionally more than one class to element

12
01:10.180 --> 01:15.200
then you can pass an object as argument. 
On the left side is a class name.

13
01:15.670 --> 01:17.930
While the right side is a boolean value.

14
01:18.640 --> 01:23.470
So a class will be applied when the value on the right side is true.

15
01:23.500 --> 01:31.060
On the contrary if the value is false then the 
class will not be applied to the element. Now

16
01:31.070 --> 01:40.010
for example I have a div and I blind the class tribute 
to my classes. The my classes here for example

17
01:40.130 --> 01:42.470
can be defined in the data property.

18
01:42.500 --> 01:44.250
Here we have alert with condition

19
01:44.250 --> 01:46.430
true then alert info class

20
01:46.430 --> 01:51.000
also true and alert dark is false.

21
01:51.010 --> 01:58.720
Now when the page is rendered this div will have alert and 
alert-info classes because besides alert dark everything

22
01:58.720 --> 02:01.460
is true. Next

23
02:01.470 --> 02:04.340
let's see how to pass in an array as an argument.

24
02:06.140 --> 02:09.930
So in array we can define one or more classes.

25
02:10.220 --> 02:17.230
The difference against objects is that all classes 
that define will be applied to the element.

26
02:17.390 --> 02:20.320
The following example is almost the same as before.

27
02:20.330 --> 02:27.430
The difference is my classes now contains array as 
you can see here we just define the class name as

28
02:27.450 --> 02:30.090
array elements separated by a comma.

29
02:30.110 --> 02:37.460
So as my classes that defined are alert and alert dark 
then when the page is rendered the div element will

30
02:37.460 --> 02:39.330
be looked like this div class

31
02:39.620 --> 02:41.610
alert alert-dark.

32
02:41.670 --> 02:44.890
Now what if we want to pass an array as class argument

33
02:45.110 --> 02:48.380
but we also want to conditionally apply a certain class?

34
02:48.380 --> 02:57.310
We can do that like this if the condition is met we 
specify a class or if not met then we define an empty

35
02:57.310 --> 03:00.130
string or another class.

36
03:00.210 --> 03:06.870
If we take a look at this example here in this 
div the class attribute bound to my classes.

37
03:06.880 --> 03:13.680
Then here if the condition was false then 
the class that will be return is text-dark.

38
03:14.170 --> 03:21.260
Otherwise if the condition was true then 
the class that will be returned is text white.

39
03:21.260 --> 03:26.390
So when the page is rendered this 
div element will be has text dark

40
03:26.460 --> 03:33.460
if we assume the condition is false or if the condition is true then this div element will be has text

41
03:33.490 --> 03:36.010
white class. Now

42
03:36.100 --> 03:40.820
if you want to bind only a single class 
to element then you can pass a string.

43
03:41.020 --> 03:46.260
Here we bind the class attribute to my class in my class

44
03:46.260 --> 03:54.500
we can define a class name text center like so. When 
the page is rendered the div element will be has

45
03:55.170 --> 03:56.540
text center class.

46
03:57.030 --> 03:58.970
OK that's about class binding

47
03:59.120 --> 04:03.950
We can dynamically apply one or several 
classes to a particular element.

48
04:05.880 --> 04:07.260
Now let's see in action.
