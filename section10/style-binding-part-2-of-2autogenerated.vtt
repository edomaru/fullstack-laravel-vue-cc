00:01.580 --> 00:07.470
Let's open style bindings 4 dot html. I gave 
the wrong number to the file actually but

1
00:07.730 --> 00:09.440
it's OK.

2
00:10.460 --> 00:14.160
Here we have a progress bar and a range input.

3
00:14.180 --> 00:21.040
Now what we have to do here is increasing the progress 
bar when we drug the range from left to the right

4
00:21.440 --> 00:24.560
or vice versa.

5
00:24.560 --> 00:31.070
All right let's go to our editor and open style 
bindings 4 dot html. Here what do we

6
00:31.070 --> 00:32.100
need to change

7
00:32.140 --> 00:38.780
is the css with property dynamically and we need 
to perform style bindings here and maybe we also

8
00:38.780 --> 00:40.530
need to change the text here.

9
00:42.400 --> 00:50.100
The first thing we're going to do is to bind this 
range input and we can define a property inside

10
00:50.100 --> 00:50.970
the data property.

11
00:55.900 --> 01:06.550
So let's define data and inside it let's define with and let's 
set zero by default. Next let's perform model binding

12
01:06.550 --> 01:10.860
to the input by adding v-model

13
01:13.960 --> 01:14.620
equals with

14
01:21.600 --> 01:23.700
then style binding the progress bar

15
01:31.800 --> 01:33.060
pass an object as argument

16
01:36.060 --> 01:36.630
here

17
01:36.710 --> 01:38.690
let's define with css property

18
01:42.820 --> 01:52.900
and for the value we can take from with 
property concatenated with percent.

19
01:52.940 --> 01:57.030
So again for css property we can write it like this

20
02:00.180 --> 02:02.220
or use quotation marks like this

21
02:02.340 --> 02:09.430
but it's not mandatory as long as the css property 
is in one word. Then here we can show the with as

22
02:09.630 --> 02:10.150
a text

23
02:17.740 --> 02:18.730
OK let's save

24
02:21.770 --> 02:22.650
and have a look.

25
02:24.500 --> 02:32.070
Now if we try dragging the range input as you can see 
the width of the progress bar changes or increasing

26
02:33.940 --> 02:35.060
as you see in here.

27
02:38.310 --> 02:41.730
Its value will be in sync with the value of the range and input.

28
02:48.240 --> 02:48.660
Next

29
02:48.650 --> 02:51.450
let's open style bindings 4 dot html

30
02:56.130 --> 02:57.450
here we have a heading

31
03:01.050 --> 03:08.990
then below that we have some style options that we 
can apply to this heading. OK let's go back to our

32
03:08.990 --> 03:11.150
editor then open

33
03:11.180 --> 03:18.560
style bindings 5 dot html. AS you can see 
here we have several select elements

34
03:24.780 --> 03:26.340
then in data property

35
03:26.340 --> 03:35.520
there are several css style definitions style 1 background 
white, style 2 color black, style 3 border

36
03:35.550 --> 03:38.950
2 pixels and style 4 text transformation.

37
03:39.160 --> 03:45.690
Now what we have to do here is apply these 
four styles dynamically to the heading.

38
03:45.770 --> 03:49.790
So the first thing that we need to do here is to bind the four styles

39
03:52.980 --> 03:54.490
to the select elements here.

40
03:55.810 --> 03:58.570
So let's make selection to all select opening tags

41
04:03.540 --> 04:06.400
once selected we can add v-model

42
04:12.310 --> 04:18.110
then pass in each style.

43
04:18.190 --> 04:19.480
Let's start from style 1

44
04:23.470 --> 04:39.950
here we need to change the background color property. 
Then for style 2 we can bind the color property

45
04:40.140 --> 04:43.590
Then for the style 3 we can bind to the border property

46
04:50.380 --> 04:50.850
and the last

47
04:50.890 --> 04:56.410
for the style 4 we can bind to text transform property.

48
04:56.410 --> 05:01.020
So what we do here is to dynamically 
change the values of each style.

49
05:03.580 --> 05:08.400
Next let's apply its style to this heading element.

50
05:11.920 --> 05:13.240
Here we add style binding

51
05:16.220 --> 05:20.860
pass an array as argument and inside the array we just add

52
05:21.170 --> 05:24.720
style 1, style 2

53
05:27.710 --> 05:31.400
style 3 and style 4

54
05:31.400 --> 05:42.620
So all these styles will be merged into one css 
style definition and apply to the heading save.

55
05:42.630 --> 05:48.550
Now let's try to change the background color to red, green

56
05:49.990 --> 05:50.870
and blue.

57
05:51.310 --> 06:03.200
Then for the text color let's change to white or yellow. 
For border we can also change for example to 4 pixels,

58
06:03.740 --> 06:09.680
8 pixels. For the text  let's try to change to capitalize, uppercase

59
06:11.450 --> 06:12.270
and lowercase.

60
06:15.450 --> 06:18.410
OK that's all about style bindings.

61
06:18.420 --> 06:20.990
I'll see you in the next lesson.
