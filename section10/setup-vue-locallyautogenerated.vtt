In the previous lesson I use js fiddle to play 
around with vue js with a minimum set up

1
00:07.630 --> 00:10.510
and it allows you to follow along easily.

2
00:10.670 --> 00:17.060
Now in this lesson I want to show you how the 
set up vue js locally. Firstly you need to choose

3
00:17.120 --> 00:20.700
the location where you want to put your vue js application.

4
00:20.750 --> 00:24.070
In my case I'll put it in desktop. Then here

5
00:24.200 --> 00:30.090
let's create a new folder and I'll call it vue app

6
00:30.340 --> 00:33.990
Now we can open our favorite code editor.

7
00:34.200 --> 00:41.790
In this case I'll be using Atom which is my 
another favorite editor. Back to desktop

8
00:41.850 --> 00:48.670
and here we can simply drag the folder 
into our editor then let's create new file

9
00:53.300 --> 00:55.970
and let's call it index dot HTML.

10
00:59.930 --> 01:02.920
Let's create HTML 5 boilerplate. 

11
01:02.920 --> 01:11.290
Here I have Emett plug in install so that I can type 
html colon 5 and then hit tab to generate HTML

12
01:11.330 --> 01:14.110
five boilerplate

13
01:14.330 --> 01:20.910
If you're using visual studio code editor the 
emmet extension has installed by default.

14
01:20.910 --> 01:26.700
Now let's switch back over to our browser. Here in HTML section

15
01:26.760 --> 01:30.990
we can copy everything back to our editor

16
01:34.100 --> 01:36.210
here in body just paste the code.

17
01:40.260 --> 01:42.030
Then here we can move the script tag

18
01:47.690 --> 01:48.740
inside the head tag

19
01:51.730 --> 01:55.330
or we can place it on the bottom before body closing tag.

20
01:58.550 --> 02:03.770
Let's switch back over to our browser 
and here in the script section

21
02:04.010 --> 02:05.060
Let's copy everything

22
02:11.730 --> 02:13.680
and then here let's add another script

23
02:17.360 --> 02:19.810
and paste our vue js script inside.

24
02:26.580 --> 02:31.710
Save let's switch back to our browser.

25
02:31.930 --> 02:35.680
And here we can run our vue js application by open a new tab

26
02:38.610 --> 02:45.010
choosing File menu then open file and then choose the html file.

27
02:48.200 --> 02:52.160
OK here our vue js application working like in js fiddle.

28
02:52.430 --> 02:56.510
But still we load the vue js file from cdn.

29
02:56.550 --> 03:01.360
Now let's also put the vue js file as a local file. In order to do that

30
03:01.440 --> 03:09.470
let's switch back over to vue js official guide. And 
here we will find two buttons for our development

31
03:09.510 --> 03:15.550
we need vue js development version which will gives us 
extra warnings and errors during our development.

32
03:15.770 --> 03:16.920
Production ready app

33
03:17.010 --> 03:20.940
we can choose this production version button.

34
03:21.030 --> 03:26.910
All right let's hit this development version

35
03:27.180 --> 03:39.240
and then here I'll save into vue app and to make application organized we can create new folder here I'll call it

36
03:40.090 --> 03:49.940
js and then hit save.

37
03:49.950 --> 04:06.800
Now here we can change the script 
source with our local vue js file.

38
04:06.980 --> 04:15.230
Now if we reload the page we will got the same thing 
as before but now we load the vue js file locally.

39
04:15.250 --> 04:17.130
Now if you're using Atom like me

40
04:17.290 --> 04:23.160
you can install plugin called atom live server. This plugin 
allows you to launch a development local server 

41
04:23.400 --> 04:25.050
with liver reload feature.

42
04:25.050 --> 04:31.290
Similarly if you're using a visual studio code editor 
you can install extension called live server which

43
04:31.290 --> 04:41.370
has a similar feature. So let me close this tab then I'll switch to my code editor and here I can start live

44
04:41.370 --> 04:52.720
server by hitting the packages menu choose atom live 
server then choose start server. Once it's run it will

45
04:52.720 --> 04:54.890
open our project in new browser's tab.

46
04:57.800 --> 04:59.630
Now if I change something here

47
05:10.010 --> 05:10.760
And then save

48
05:13.340 --> 05:17.780
here the change reflected immediately and 
I don't need to reload the page manually.

49
05:17.910 --> 05:20.500
And that's something called live reload feature.

50
05:20.910 --> 05:24.790
So that's how you could set up the 
vue js locally. In the next lessons

51
05:24.830 --> 05:30.180
we're going to learn a lot more about 
vue js. So I'll see you in the next lesson.
