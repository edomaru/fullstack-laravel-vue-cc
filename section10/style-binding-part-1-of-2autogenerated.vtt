In this lesson we're going to learn about style binding. 
The style binding is a mechanism for dynamically

1
00:07.350 --> 00:14.490
applying one or more css style definitions to 
a particular element. To do so we can use the

2
00:14.740 --> 00:17.140
v-bind colon style directive

3
00:18.230 --> 00:26.700
then pass an argument or we can use the shorthand 
syntax just colon style then pass in the argument.

4
00:26.930 --> 00:32.060
The argument here can be an object or an array. First up

5
00:32.270 --> 00:35.220
let's see how to define css styles in object

6
00:35.390 --> 00:38.650
and pass it as style binding argument.

7
00:38.660 --> 00:47.310
Now here we defined the css style as key value 
pair where the key is css property and value is

8
00:47.310 --> 00:49.990
the value of css property.

9
00:50.000 --> 00:57.050
So here we can specify one or more css properties 
as we do in the regular css but one thing

10
00:57.050 --> 01:04.730
to be noticed here is because generally css property 
can consist of one or several words separated

11
01:04.740 --> 01:05.890
by dash

12
01:06.020 --> 01:13.610
then we can safely write it in camel case such as 
font size like so. Or it can be written in snake case

13
01:14.240 --> 01:17.130
but it must be enclosed in quotation marks.

14
01:19.150 --> 01:27.310
So for background color for example we can write in camel case 
like this or in snake case background dash color just like

15
01:27.310 --> 01:31.840
we write in normal css. Let's see an example.

16
01:32.710 --> 01:41.020
Here we do style bending to my classes then in data 
property for example we defined my classes as an

17
01:41.020 --> 01:50.220
object contains color blue, padding two pixels. When 
the page is rendered the div will have style color

18
01:50.430 --> 01:54.450
blue, padding two pixels.

19
01:54.460 --> 02:00.270
Next up we can style binding and pass in css style as array.

20
02:00.290 --> 02:07.070
This usually when we need to apply several style 
definitions so maybe we define some groups of style

21
02:07.190 --> 02:15.650
such as custom style 1, custom style 2 and so on then 
from some of these styles we can combine them into

22
02:15.650 --> 02:19.050
an element by defining them in an array like this.

23
02:20.590 --> 02:31.720
For example here I have a div and it's style binding to a 
and b where a and b defined in data property. a contains

24
02:31.720 --> 02:35.670
color white then b font size 12 pixels

25
02:37.180 --> 02:41.500
Here I only to find one css property for every single style.

26
02:41.650 --> 02:49.630
But in practice we can define more than one css 
property. Now a and b will be merged so that when

27
02:49.630 --> 02:55.520
the page is rendered this div will have style color white font size 12 pixels.

28
02:55.560 --> 02:56.180
All right

29
02:56.190 --> 03:02.260
that's all about style bindings. We can dynamically 
apply inline css to element by passing css 

30
03:02.260 --> 03:04.760
styles in object or array

31
03:04.800 --> 03:07.240
if we need to combine several styles.

32
03:07.240 --> 03:08.810
OK let's see in action.
