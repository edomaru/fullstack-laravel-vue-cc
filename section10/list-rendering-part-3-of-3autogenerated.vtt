00:03.140 --> 00:06.160
Now let's implement the v for on a single object

1
00:11.650 --> 00:17.450
let's open list rendering four dot html and 
here we'll do the same thing as before

2
00:17.590 --> 00:21.100
which display a list of the top 10 frameworks and their course.

3
00:25.570 --> 00:33.340
Now  let's switch over to our editor than 
open list rendering four dot html.

4
00:33.440 --> 00:38.770
Here we have the same markup but 
the difference here is in the data

5
00:41.850 --> 00:42.940
as we can see here

6
00:43.020 --> 00:48.030
This is a simple form of previous data 
but now they are stored in single object

7
00:48.210 --> 00:52.730
So each framework and score represented in a single property.

8
00:52.930 --> 01:00.390
The framework name as a key and the score as a value.

9
01:00.410 --> 01:02.150
All right let's jump to our markup

10
01:06.090 --> 01:07.790
remove these list items

11
01:11.790 --> 01:12.600
also this one

12
01:18.170 --> 01:24.590
here we can use the v-for directive by including the 
index as before it should be noted here that the

13
01:24.590 --> 01:25.580
property value

14
01:28.720 --> 01:34.100
in this case the score will be item on the left side.

15
01:35.470 --> 01:43.340
And the property key in this case the framework 
name will be index on the right side.

16
01:43.420 --> 01:52.280
So v-for equals parenthesis score comma framework of top

17
01:56.540 --> 01:57.410
ten frameworks

18
02:00.890 --> 02:10.070
then let's change the text to framework and 
then we change the number to score.

19
02:15.750 --> 02:16.140
OK

20
02:16.140 --> 02:19.780
here we get the same result as before.

21
02:21.040 --> 02:29.580
Finally let's look at how to implement 
the v-for on an array of object.

22
02:29.760 --> 02:32.300
Let's open list rendering five dot html

23
02:37.700 --> 02:40.470
and here we will display the top ten framework in a table

24
02:43.190 --> 02:46.360
so its framework will have a score from GitHub

25
02:46.460 --> 02:51.270
stack over flow and overall score.

26
02:51.710 --> 02:58.230
Let's switch over to editor an open list rendering five dot html.

27
03:01.850 --> 03:06.400
jump to script section.

28
03:06.550 --> 03:13.200
And here we see the top ten framework property which 
contains array of objects each element consist of

29
03:13.420 --> 03:20.090
name GitHub stack overflow and overall.

30
03:20.100 --> 03:28.150
Now let's jump to the table then leave two table rows 
because we need to iterate one table row and the

31
03:28.150 --> 03:39.750
rest will be the table heading.

32
03:39.830 --> 03:47.360
Here we can say v-for equals framework of top ten frameworks

33
03:52.370 --> 04:00.200
and here to show the framework name 
we can say framework dot name.

34
04:00.270 --> 04:09.180
And then for the GitHub score we can say framework dot github

35
04:09.390 --> 04:23.030
And then for the stack over flow score framework dot 
stack overflow and the last we can say framework

36
04:24.030 --> 04:24.870
dot overall

37
04:30.270 --> 04:31.970
let's switch to our browser.

38
04:32.370 --> 04:40.830
And here we will see the top 10 framework displayed
in the table each framework has score from github stack

39
04:40.830 --> 04:45.080
overflow and overall. Alright

40
04:45.180 --> 04:47.700
so that's about the list rendering.

41
04:47.700 --> 04:54.450
Hopefully from these experiments you get the idea about 
list rendering in vue js and how to use it to display

42
04:54.450 --> 04:56.770
different types of collection properly.
