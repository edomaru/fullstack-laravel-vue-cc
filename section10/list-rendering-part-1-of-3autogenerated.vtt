In software development we always deal 
with collection of data in most cases.

1
00:07.690 --> 00:14.170
We might display them in a list if each data item 
is a single information or they could be display

2
00:14.200 --> 00:15.240
in a table

3
00:15.300 --> 00:23.690
If each data item consist of more than one related 
information or records. In this lesson we will learn how

4
00:23.690 --> 00:27.700
to present data in the form of list or table using vue js

5
00:27.700 --> 00:35.690
v-for directive. The v-for directive can be used to 
iterate collections the syntax of this directives

6
00:35.830 --> 00:43.990
is in the form of item in items or item of 
items where items is source data array

7
00:44.200 --> 00:49.840
while item is an alias for the array element being iterated on.

8
00:49.840 --> 00:59.080
in practice we can use the v-for for ranges 
arrays objects and array of objects.

9
00:59.080 --> 01:05.700
This v-for will replicate the html element where 
we're defining it in the element. To follow along

10
01:05.710 --> 01:06.420
this lesson

11
01:06.460 --> 01:12.570
You can download the file in the course resource 
then you can extract it and open it in your favorite

12
01:12.610 --> 01:15.620
editor. If you use atom like me

13
01:15.700 --> 01:22.620
you can also install atom live server plugin which allows 
you to run the http server on the current project

14
01:22.720 --> 01:24.360
that opened in the browser.

15
01:24.550 --> 01:29.830
Another advantage of this plugin is the ability to 
live reload so that any changes that we made in

16
01:29.830 --> 01:34.110
the file will be automatically reload the page. OK

17
01:34.120 --> 01:41.050
firstly let's make use the v-for directive to iterate 
a range of number. Let's open the list rendering

18
01:41.050 --> 01:44.030
one dot html

19
01:44.110 --> 01:52.510
Here we have a list which currently hard coded. And 
it contains list one through list ten. We will make

20
01:52.510 --> 02:00.760
changes this list to be dynamic by making use of 
the v-for directive. Let's switch over to our editor

21
02:01.140 --> 02:08.090
and then let's open up the list rendering one dot html.

22
02:08.100 --> 02:14.640
Here we have unordered list which has a class list 
group and some of list items with class list group

23
02:14.640 --> 02:15.390
item.

24
02:15.390 --> 02:19.930
These are classes that are provided by 
bootstraps to make all list beautiful.

25
02:19.980 --> 02:25.180
Here we have vue js included and we need 
to add another script to put our own script.

26
02:28.240 --> 02:29.190
Let's instanciate

27
02:29.220 --> 02:30.150
the vue instance

28
02:33.650 --> 02:41.320
then specify the el property with hash tag app as defined in here.

29
02:45.300 --> 02:49.500
OK here let's leave one list item and remove the rest.

30
02:50.740 --> 02:57.080
Then inside this list item we can say v-for equals

31
03:00.090 --> 03:03.320
and then let's say n in 10.

32
03:03.510 --> 03:08.810
So this name is totally up to you but in my case I call it n.

33
03:09.020 --> 03:11.070
And then let's change this text to list

34
03:17.090 --> 03:20.860
or let's make use the string interpolation list

35
03:23.620 --> 03:28.150
and then concatenate with n variable.

36
03:28.160 --> 03:31.910
Now if I save and switch to browser

37
03:34.930 --> 03:37.320
we will find it no difference.

38
03:37.320 --> 03:43.270
So let me change the range to let's say five our list

39
03:43.290 --> 03:46.130
should we change.

40
03:46.320 --> 03:48.320
Now here we have five list items.
