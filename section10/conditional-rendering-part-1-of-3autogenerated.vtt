Hiding or showing elements is something that we might 
often encounter in modern web applications for

1
00:09.250 --> 00:15.270
example we might display a form modal when a button 
is clicked or hide it when other element being clicked.

2
00:17.280 --> 00:21.250
We might also display a message when no data is found or hide it

3
00:21.270 --> 00:30.080
if no record found without need to reload the page and 
much more. Vue js provides a mechanism for showing

4
00:30.170 --> 00:33.050
or hiding elements based on certain conditions.

5
00:33.770 --> 00:40.490
The first one is the v-if directive. The v-if will add 
or remove element in the DOM conditionally

6
00:43.980 --> 00:45.330
it will add an element

7
00:45.360 --> 00:48.360
where it's defined when it's evaluates to true

8
00:48.680 --> 00:53.080
or it will remove the element dynamically if it evaluates to false.

9
00:55.290 --> 00:55.840
All right

10
00:55.890 --> 00:57.580
let's open conditional rendering

11
00:57.590 --> 01:02.490
one dot html.

12
01:02.690 --> 01:04.830
And here we have a message.

13
01:04.910 --> 01:15.230
You have no any record and a hide message button. We will 
hide this message or remove the message to be precise if the

14
01:15.230 --> 01:25.510
hide message button is clicked. Let's switch back over to 
our editor then open conditional rendering one dot html

15
01:28.370 --> 01:30.400
and here the message that we will hidden.

16
01:34.300 --> 01:47.690
So here we can say v-if equals and then pass in a value 
let's say hide alert. Now we can go to vue option

17
01:55.150 --> 01:56.500
then define data property.

18
02:00.270 --> 02:02.850
Inside here let's define hide alert property

19
02:07.460 --> 02:08.720
and it will be true by default

20
02:11.770 --> 02:18.140
actually let me just change the name to show 
alert because I think it's more descriptive.

21
02:18.490 --> 02:21.640
Let's save and let's make sure that the message still appears.

22
02:26.210 --> 02:27.760
OK in this button

23
02:27.990 --> 02:32.250
let's define an event handling by making use v-on click directive

24
02:36.530 --> 02:37.470
then inside here

25
02:37.510 --> 02:38.920
let's change the show alert

26
02:41.290 --> 02:41.990
to false.

27
02:46.670 --> 02:49.670
save back to our browser.

28
02:49.810 --> 02:58.230
And let's see now if I click the hide message 
button now the message disappears.

29
03:01.350 --> 03:09.500
So by changing the show alert to false this alert will 
be hidden because the condition in v-if directive is

30
03:09.500 --> 03:10.080
not met.

31
03:12.510 --> 03:19.190
In the real cases we usually show this kind of message
if there's no record found or hide it when records

32
03:19.230 --> 03:24.100
found for example here we can check if the record is empty

33
03:29.620 --> 03:35.050
record dot length and show alert is true

34
03:35.070 --> 03:40.310
then we show the alert.

35
03:40.310 --> 03:49.330
So in other word the alert will be hidden if the data 
is not empty or if we click the hide message button.

36
03:49.500 --> 03:54.240
Now in the data property we can define a new property

37
04:00.210 --> 04:04.330
records which is an empty array.

38
04:04.430 --> 04:09.240
In practice we can fill these records with the real 
data that we retrieve from the back end API

39
04:09.260 --> 04:11.010
through AJAX.

40
04:11.140 --> 04:15.090
Let's see here the alert still appears.

41
04:15.480 --> 04:21.220
Now we can try to hit the hide message button and now it's gone

42
04:25.490 --> 04:25.890
now

43
04:25.920 --> 04:28.820
If we filled this records property with any data

44
04:35.320 --> 04:37.210
now the alert will be disappears.
