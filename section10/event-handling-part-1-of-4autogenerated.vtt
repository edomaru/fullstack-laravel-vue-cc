In this lesson we'll learn about the event handling in vue js

1
00:05.640 --> 00:12.490
Actually we have used the event handling in the previous 
lesson but this time we'll discuss it in more depth.

2
00:13.140 --> 00:17.460
So event is something that happens inside the HTML element.

3
00:17.460 --> 00:21.000
It can be triggered by the browser or by the user.

4
00:21.000 --> 00:24.810
For example the page has finished loaded a button clicked

5
00:26.290 --> 00:33.410
An input changes because the user type something 
in it mouse move or a form submitted.

6
00:34.730 --> 00:39.950
When an event occurs we might want to 
do something by excluding javascript code.

7
00:39.950 --> 00:42.600
Actually here there are two things.

8
00:42.620 --> 00:45.370
First listen listen to the event.

9
00:45.930 --> 00:51.130
And second do something or handling the event.

10
00:51.220 --> 00:59.820
So we do something to listen the event. In vue js we 
can handle events using the v-on directive and define

11
00:59.860 --> 01:03.230
javascript code to be executed when the event is triggered.

12
01:04.110 --> 01:05.880
v-on requires an argument

13
01:06.010 --> 01:09.380
that is the name of the event that we want to listen to.

14
01:10.260 --> 01:18.900
For example click or other available events such 
as double click mouse move mouse out etc.

15
01:19.310 --> 01:28.330
Then we can define javascript expression in it. Vue js also 
provides a shorthand syntax for the 'v-on:' which is '@'

16
01:28.330 --> 01:36.240
symbol. Now let's open the event handling one dot html.

17
01:36.340 --> 01:41.860
And here we have three js frameworks listed 
and each item has a button for voting.

18
01:44.740 --> 01:45.100
Later

19
01:45.100 --> 01:51.520
we will make use the v-on click on each button so 
that when we click it the number of votes for each

20
01:51.520 --> 01:54.480
framework will be increasing.

21
01:54.480 --> 01:56.420
Now let's switch over to our editor.

22
01:57.880 --> 02:01.290
Then open up the event handling one dot html file. In a

23
02:03.860 --> 02:04.310
button

24
02:04.360 --> 02:05.910
we can add an event handler

25
02:06.130 --> 02:07.920
that is when we click it

26
02:07.930 --> 02:12.500
the number of vote will be increasing v on click

27
02:16.920 --> 02:17.770
framework

28
02:23.380 --> 02:24.920
votes plus plus.

29
02:30.790 --> 02:32.720
Now let's switch back over to our browser

30
02:35.870 --> 02:40.550
and now if we click on each button the 
number of votes will be increasing

31
02:50.070 --> 02:54.540
the javascript expression that we defined 
in the event can be a complex logic.

32
02:54.580 --> 02:58.150
Maybe it consists of several lines of code.

33
02:58.190 --> 03:01.870
Therefore in this v-on directive we can also call a method name

34
03:01.970 --> 03:04.830
that we want to call. In this v-on click

35
03:04.850 --> 03:05.890
let's change to up vote and pass

36
03:12.540 --> 03:18.720
the framework in.

37
03:18.790 --> 03:21.040
We could also use the v-on shorthand syntax

38
03:23.910 --> 03:31.260
just @ symbol to make it much simpler.

39
03:31.480 --> 03:34.450
Then in vue option we can define methods property

40
03:39.690 --> 03:41.230
then create the up vote method

41
03:49.820 --> 03:50.810
inside the method

42
03:50.810 --> 03:57.330
we do almost the same thing as before 
framework dot vote plus plus

43
04:00.790 --> 04:07.530
if we go back to our browser and click 
on each button it looks no difference.
