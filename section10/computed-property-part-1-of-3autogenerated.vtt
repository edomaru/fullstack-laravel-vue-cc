In the previous lessons you've seen how to store 
some values that will use in the vue js application

1
00:07.220 --> 00:09.380
by defining them in data property.

2
00:09.590 --> 00:13.850
We can then retrieve the values and display them in our template.

3
00:13.970 --> 00:22.430
Now in other use case we might need to manipulate one 
or some of values before render to the page. For example

4
00:22.520 --> 00:29.170
we might have first name and last name defined in data 
property then maybe we need to display full name

5
00:29.210 --> 00:36.230
in our template. Here we can do that 
by using string interpolation like this.

6
00:36.350 --> 00:43.040
This is OK but it's limited only single expression. 
If we need to show the full name in other places

7
00:44.450 --> 00:47.570
then we might need to copy and paste that expression.

8
00:47.900 --> 00:51.690
And this will produce repeated code in our app.

9
00:51.700 --> 01:00.310
Now let's say we also need to show the full name 
in uppercase and add a space between characters.

10
01:00.360 --> 01:07.510
Here we can do that like this. Or we 
can do it more simpler just like this.

11
01:07.580 --> 01:12.160
But once again this will make our 
template messy and not declarative

12
01:12.200 --> 01:14.900
It doesn't really describe what we were trying to do.

13
01:15.740 --> 01:22.940
So you have to consider that your views or templates 
should only be concerned with displaying data.

14
01:23.050 --> 01:28.420
If you find that a piece of data needs a bit of 
computation before it's rendered to the page

15
01:28.810 --> 01:30.830
then you have two alternatives.

16
01:31.030 --> 01:36.320
The first one is to apply the logic in methods property.

17
01:36.490 --> 01:43.450
So from the previous example we can define let's say 
full name upper with space and place the of logic

18
01:43.450 --> 01:44.020
in it.

19
01:44.800 --> 01:52.210
Then in your template you can call full 
name upper with space parentheses.

20
01:52.380 --> 01:59.740
The second one is to place the logic in computed property. Computed properties are defined in the computed

21
01:59.740 --> 02:01.680
property of vue option.

22
02:01.840 --> 02:07.720
And in here you you define the same function as before 
but now in your template you can call the computed

23
02:07.720 --> 02:09.260
property just like this

24
02:10.470 --> 02:12.060
full name upper with space

25
02:12.220 --> 02:15.340
just like property that you define in data property.

26
02:15.340 --> 02:20.800
You don't need parentheses when calling computed 
property and vue js will automatically invokes the

27
02:20.800 --> 02:27.120
function behind the scene. Besides that a 
computed party has a following features

28
02:27.120 --> 02:29.270
First the computation will be cached

29
02:29.310 --> 02:33.030
that means the function will not rerun if not necessary.

30
02:33.030 --> 02:40.550
It's prevent useless computation. The second it will only 
automatically update as needed when dependent

31
02:40.550 --> 02:43.020
properties inside the function has changed.

32
02:43.310 --> 02:47.900
So that's about a brief intro about computed 
properties. The computer properties

33
02:47.930 --> 02:53.840
basically are data in vue instance or vue components 
that depends on some calculation on other

34
02:53.840 --> 02:55.420
data.

35
02:55.460 --> 02:56.900
All right let's see an action.
