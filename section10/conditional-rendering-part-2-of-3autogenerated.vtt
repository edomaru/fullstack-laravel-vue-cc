00:03.750 --> 00:08.890
Besides v-if vue js also provides another 
mechanism for this displaying element

1
00:08.940 --> 00:14.260
If the v-if condition does not met or 
in other words when the v-if is false.

2
00:14.610 --> 00:18.200
We can make use the v-else directive

3
00:18.400 --> 00:23.190
Now let's open the conditional rendering two dot html

4
00:23.290 --> 00:28.750
And here we have two alerts show up. 
Let's say here we'll hide the message

5
00:28.750 --> 00:34.880
You have some records when no record found otherwise hide the message

6
00:34.890 --> 00:40.520
You have no any records if any records 
found. Let's switch back over to our editor

7
00:43.200 --> 00:46.220
then open the conditional rendering two dot html

8
00:51.010 --> 00:59.350
and then here we just define v-else we 
don't need to specify any values here.

9
00:59.550 --> 01:06.830
just v-else only. Let's see now the second message disappear.

10
01:08.500 --> 01:14.060
If we try to change the records with any values. Let's have a look

11
01:16.060 --> 01:23.990
Now we'll have the second message appears. Besides v-if 
and v-else vue js also provides another directive that is

12
01:24.350 --> 01:30.530
v-else-if we can make use of this directive if we have
more than two different elements that we want to show

13
01:30.590 --> 01:39.630
or hide based on certain conditions. Just like v-if 
this directive receives a boolean value when the

14
01:39.630 --> 01:48.550
value is true the element where it is placed 
will be shown or hidden when it's false.

15
01:48.550 --> 01:50.980
Now let's open the conditional rendering three dot

16
01:51.100 --> 01:51.530
html

17
01:55.460 --> 02:00.680
and here we have three alerts show up for 
example here we want to show the message

18
02:00.680 --> 02:02.160
You have no any records

19
02:02.210 --> 02:06.860
If there was no records found at all and two other alerts  hidden

20
02:09.480 --> 02:15.810
or we want to show the message you have only one record if there is only one record found and two other

21
02:15.810 --> 02:18.730
alerts hidden or we want to show the message

22
02:18.810 --> 02:24.420
you have more than 1 records if there are more 
than one record found and two other alerts will be

23
02:24.420 --> 02:34.490
hidden. Let's switch back over to our editor then open conditional 
rendering three dot html. In this first alert we can

24
02:34.550 --> 02:35.030
define

25
02:38.000 --> 02:38.470
v if

26
02:41.100 --> 02:45.360
data length less than zero.

27
02:46.480 --> 02:50.180
Then in the second alert

28
02:50.360 --> 02:57.340
we can define v else if equals data dot length

29
03:00.080 --> 03:00.830
is equals one

30
03:03.650 --> 03:11.020
then here in the third alert we can define v else

31
03:11.030 --> 03:15.690
Now let's see.

32
03:15.790 --> 03:17.400
Something went wrong.

33
03:17.530 --> 03:18.170
Let me see

34
03:23.820 --> 03:25.370
data is not defined

35
03:25.700 --> 03:34.280
Anyway this should be records not data because if I go to data

36
03:34.490 --> 03:36.100
This is the record property that I mean

37
03:39.150 --> 03:43.920
well this should be less than 1 meaning that the record is empty.

38
03:45.550 --> 03:49.910
OK now the first alert appears.

39
03:49.950 --> 03:57.150
Now let's try to change the value of this 
records with one data and then have a look.

40
04:00.450 --> 04:03.460
OK now the second alert appears.

41
04:03.610 --> 04:12.600
Let's try to change the value of the records again 
with two or more data and then let's have a look

42
04:12.610 --> 04:18.640
again.

43
04:18.720 --> 04:20.030
Now on the third alert appears.
