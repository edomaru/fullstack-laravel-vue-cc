Hi

1
00:01.680 --> 00:07.050
Welcome to fullstack web development with Laravel and Vue.js course the best and complete online

2
00:07.050 --> 00:14.190
resource for learning full stack web apps with Laravel, Vue.js, bootstrap, and other technologies.

3
00:14.190 --> 00:20.620
My name is Eding Muhamad Saprudin and I'm Fullstack web developer with more a decade of programming experience.

4
00:20.880 --> 00:25.710
Now without further ado I want to give you a quick overview of what project that we're going gonna build

5
00:25.710 --> 00:29.190
in this course and what exactly you're gonna learn.

6
00:29.250 --> 00:32.560
So this is the main project that we're gonna build throughout the course.

7
00:32.740 --> 00:34.000
I call it Laravel Q/A

8
00:34.020 --> 00:41.540
A single page application or SPA that inspired by stackoverflow. In the front page

9
00:41.550 --> 00:45.500
We'll have a list of questions. If you scroll down

10
00:45.640 --> 00:52.490
There are simple pagination that allows us to navigate to previous or next page. If we hit the older

11
00:52.490 --> 00:55.810
button it'll bring us to the next page.

12
00:55.850 --> 00:59.100
So as you can see the URL changes

13
00:59.120 --> 01:01.870
while we hit the button without need to reload the page.

14
01:02.120 --> 01:08.360
Once we reach in the first or last page the button is going to be inactive. To create a new question

15
01:09.050 --> 01:11.430
we can hit this ask Question button.

16
01:11.810 --> 01:19.580
It'll take us to ask question page. In this page we can enter the question title and question body then

17
01:19.580 --> 01:27.420
hit the save button. The question will be saved into database and it brings us back to all questions page.

18
01:28.050 --> 01:31.080
If we hit a single question it will take us to questions

19
01:31.080 --> 01:39.080
details. This page contain question along with related answers. If we hit the load more answers button

20
01:39.800 --> 01:41.450
more answers will be get loaded.

21
01:42.720 --> 01:46.280
You can answer a certain question in this form.

22
01:46.320 --> 01:51.480
You're write in markdown syntax and you'll also able to preview your question before actually hit

23
01:51.480 --> 01:53.710
the submit button.

24
01:53.940 --> 02:00.780
Now the current users logged in can also see all questions and answers that have been created by accessing

25
02:00.860 --> 02:09.780
this link. In this page they can see all the questions and answers, only questions

26
02:11.450 --> 02:17.030
Or answers. So that's the project that we're gonna build in this course.

27
02:17.030 --> 02:19.620
Now let's see how this course structured.

28
02:19.750 --> 02:25.270
We start with Section 2 where we're going to set up our project and start building our first CRUD for

29
02:25.270 --> 02:27.400
managing questions of our Laravel

30
02:27.400 --> 02:28.310
Q/A app.

31
02:28.360 --> 02:35.380
You'll also learn some Laravel features such as database migration, Database Seeds, model factories, accessor

32
02:35.380 --> 02:41.940
and muttators, form validation, authentication and authorization. in Section 3

33
02:41.950 --> 02:47.650
We're gonna build our second CRUD for managing answers and learn some techniques such as a Eloquent

34
02:47.670 --> 02:54.850
relationship, eloquent event, integrating fontawesome 5, utilizing laravel mix to write and compile sass

35
02:54.850 --> 02:59.510
code and JavaScript code and much more. in Section 4

36
02:59.540 --> 03:04.300
We're gonna build a vote control system including favouriting the question.

37
03:04.300 --> 03:06.340
Accepting answer as best answer

38
03:06.490 --> 03:12.700
Voting up or voting down the question and answer. In this section you will learn some techniques such

39
03:12.700 --> 03:19.850
as implementing Many to Many relationship, many to many polymorphic relationship and much more. After

40
03:19.850 --> 03:25.270
that in Section 5 you will learn how to refactor the code and implementing DRY principle.

41
03:25.360 --> 03:30.260
So make your code much cleaner and easier the maintenance. In section 6

42
03:30.280 --> 03:36.690
we are going to integrate Vue.js into our application and make it more interactive. In the section

43
03:36.690 --> 03:37.340
7

44
03:37.390 --> 03:42.850
You'll learn how to build a component that allows you to write markdown syntax and see how that look

45
03:43.030 --> 03:45.820
before you actually save it into your database.

46
03:45.820 --> 03:51.590
You'll also learn how to integrate prism.js to make your code pretty. In Section 8

47
03:51.590 --> 03:54.080
you'll learn about restful API development.

48
03:54.080 --> 03:58.570
You'll learn how to create API endpoints and test them in postman REST client.

49
03:59.210 --> 04:05.600
And finally in the last section you'll learn how to build SPA or a single page application with Vue

50
04:05.660 --> 04:11.270
and Vue Router and consume APIs that you have built in the previous section.

51
04:11.420 --> 04:16.970
Now I also provide appendix sections as additional references to help you understand a certain topic

52
04:17.180 --> 04:18.890
that's still related to this course.

53
04:19.520 --> 04:25.150
So for example if you're Vue.js newcomer then you can go to Vue.js Fundamental first

54
04:25.190 --> 04:31.760
after finishing Section 5 and before continuing to the Section 6. In this section you'll learn vue.js basic

55
04:31.820 --> 04:39.260
such as writing hello word with vue.js, list rendering, conditional rendering, class binding, computed property and

56
04:39.260 --> 04:42.680
much more. Then in upgrading level up section

57
04:42.860 --> 04:46.540
You'll see how to upgrade Laravel app to make it up to date.

58
04:46.670 --> 04:52.550
Then if you want to deploy your Laravel app then you can see how to do that in deploying Laravel app in

59
04:52.550 --> 04:57.530
Heroku or deploying Laravel app in digital ocean section.

60
04:57.650 --> 05:02.880
All right so there is a broad overview of the project that we're going to build and the course structure.

61
05:04.370 --> 05:05.740
Now in all lessons

62
05:05.840 --> 05:12.260
I always do my best to explain every bit of syntax step by step to make sure that you understand exactly

63
05:12.320 --> 05:14.240
what you're building.

64
05:14.240 --> 05:20.420
I also provide the repository with a different branches for entire course lessons so that you can see

65
05:20.420 --> 05:26.870
the current lesson and compare with yours just in case you run into error and need fixing it.

66
05:26.870 --> 05:32.540
And if you still get stuck then you can go to you to Udemy Q/A section and you can check out if other

67
05:32.540 --> 05:35.840
students may have asked the same question with yours.

68
05:35.840 --> 05:41.690
If not found then you can post your own question and I'll do my best to give you friendly support.

69
05:41.810 --> 05:43.580
Alright let's get started
