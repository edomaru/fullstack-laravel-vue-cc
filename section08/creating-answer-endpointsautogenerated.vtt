00:01.970 --> 00:06.250
In this lesson we're going to create a 
couple of endpoints for answer resource.

1
00:06.410 --> 00:11.980
This time we're not going to create a brand 
new controller like we did before. Instead

2
00:12.060 --> 00:16.010
we're going to copy our existing controller into our API folder.

3
00:16.230 --> 00:19.300
Then we're going to make some changes on it. After that

4
00:19.380 --> 00:22.560
we're going to make a couple of tests for that endpoints.

5
00:22.560 --> 00:23.070
All right

6
00:23.070 --> 00:28.570
before moving on let me go to my terminal 
and then create a new branch for this lesson.

7
00:35.980 --> 00:37.570
All right let's go to app

8
00:40.640 --> 00:45.650
Http controllers then copy this answers

9
00:45.650 --> 00:46.220
Controller

10
00:50.810 --> 00:55.830
go to Api folder then paste the file inside

11
00:58.750 --> 00:59.830
in this file

12
00:59.840 --> 01:03.230
we need to adjust the namespace. On that

13
01:03.560 --> 01:12.470
we just add Api. Also we gotta add the base controller's 
namespace because this answers controller now

14
01:12.470 --> 01:16.730
no longer in the same namespace with the this controller

15
01:29.400 --> 01:31.080
now inside this class

16
01:31.080 --> 01:37.370
we don't need this constructor because now we use 
auth:api and we've done that in the route level

17
01:41.320 --> 01:46.120
we can skip this method for now and we'll come back 
here once we have created and brand new resource

18
01:46.270 --> 01:47.170
for the answer

19
01:50.460 --> 01:54.510
here in store method we can remove the if statement

20
02:02.790 --> 02:04.580
as well as the return review

21
02:10.870 --> 02:13.010
we no longer need this edit method.

22
02:13.240 --> 02:14.590
So let's get rid of this.

23
02:22.220 --> 02:22.640
Next

24
02:22.670 --> 02:25.890
let's do almost the same thing in this method remove the if

25
02:25.900 --> 02:26.480
statement

26
02:33.100 --> 02:34.080
fix the indentation

27
02:38.360 --> 02:39.950
and remove the return view

28
02:44.620 --> 02:45.140
and last

29
02:45.780 --> 02:47.190
Let's also get rid of

30
02:47.230 --> 02:48.110
the if statement

31
02:48.150 --> 02:48.830
In this method

32
02:59.010 --> 03:02.940
also this return view

33
03:03.510 --> 03:08.910
All right let's create a brand new resource 
for transforming our answer model.

34
03:08.910 --> 03:15.390
Let's head over to our terminal and generate 
a brand new resource by saying php artisan

35
03:18.580 --> 03:23.780
make resource answer resrouce.

36
03:28.110 --> 03:29.410
Let's often the answer resource

37
03:34.390 --> 03:40.940
now since the content for this answer resource has almost 
the same structure with question details resource.

38
03:41.080 --> 03:42.730
So let's open that file

39
03:47.530 --> 03:49.000
and grab this whole lines

40
03:52.040 --> 03:53.180
back to answer resource

41
03:55.970 --> 03:59.020
paste here and let's make a bit change

42
03:59.050 --> 03:59.830
to this structure

43
04:24.320 --> 04:24.890
All right

44
04:25.000 --> 04:33.060
now let's switch back to answers controller at the 
top let's import the answer resource namespace

45
04:41.730 --> 04:43.770
then here in the index method

46
04:43.770 --> 04:49.170
firstly we can assign this command into a variable I'll call it answer

47
04:52.100 --> 05:04.480
then add a new line. In this line we can simply return 
answer resource collection and put the answer variable

48
05:04.510 --> 05:04.870
in

49
05:09.770 --> 05:11.930
here I'll change the variable to plural

50
05:17.300 --> 05:18.560
also in store method

51
05:20.120 --> 05:26.130
we can put this answer variable in new answer resource.

52
05:33.410 --> 05:33.740
All right

53
05:34.000 --> 05:36.310
I think that's all we need for this controller.

54
05:36.310 --> 05:40.680
Now the next thing that we need to do is 
to define some routes for this controller.

55
05:40.810 --> 05:43.030
Let's open up api dot php

56
05:46.630 --> 05:49.130
then here we can simply duplicate this route

57
05:52.250 --> 06:03.600
let's change the URI to questions dot answers 
and change the control reference to Api

58
06:06.550 --> 06:07.080
answer

59
06:07.080 --> 06:12.110
controller and here we still need the index action

60
06:13.010 --> 06:19.880
So let's get rid of the excerpt from here.

61
06:19.930 --> 06:20.390
All right

62
06:20.700 --> 06:21.590
let's save all changes.

63
06:25.250 --> 06:27.890
something went wrong in and answers controller.

64
06:27.950 --> 06:38.260
Let me see that

65
06:38.370 --> 06:38.940
I'm sorry

66
06:39.030 --> 06:41.320
I made typo here it should be

67
06:41.490 --> 06:45.390
`use` save. And now

68
06:45.440 --> 06:50.320
let's make some tests in postman. All right here

69
06:50.340 --> 06:56.920
let's create a new folder

70
06:57.180 --> 07:04.080
I'll call it answers.

71
07:04.140 --> 07:07.020
Now here we can duplicate this display all questions

72
07:15.280 --> 07:17.590
then I'll move it here

73
07:23.190 --> 07:30.130
and then I'll rename it to display all answers

74
07:34.540 --> 07:46.210
here the method is get the path is gonna be 
api questions one answers. Let me hit the send

75
07:46.210 --> 07:46.570
button

76
07:53.800 --> 07:58.870
sorry I made mistake in my routes. So let me go back to my editor

77
08:04.730 --> 08:13.050
actually here we need to exclude the index method. So 
I'll undo the change instead we need to have the index

78
08:13.050 --> 08:16.980
route outside of auth:api. Duplicate this line

79
08:19.740 --> 08:22.980
so the URI is going to be questions

80
08:23.310 --> 08:34.440
question answers like so. And it should be 
refer to Api answers controller

81
08:37.710 --> 08:43.740
let me save this. Back to postman hit the send button again

82
08:50.870 --> 08:51.360
OK

83
08:51.380 --> 08:55.160
here I get the expected response it contains some answers.

84
08:58.350 --> 09:02.990
OK let me save this by hitting this save button. Next

85
09:03.120 --> 09:09.630
let's test the create answer endpoint. Here we can simply 
duplicate this test request by hitting this down arrow

86
09:11.190 --> 09:15.850
then hit save as option the request name is gonna be create

87
09:19.530 --> 09:20.140
an answer

88
09:27.000 --> 09:31.940
And we'll save it in answers folder and 
then hit "save to answers" button.

89
09:32.910 --> 09:39.310
Let's change the http method to post the URL is still the same.

90
09:39.350 --> 09:42.350
We don't need to make any changes here.

91
09:42.630 --> 09:47.990
Let's go to headers option and specify in column

92
09:48.360 --> 09:54.390
Accept while in value column is gonna be application json.

93
09:57.530 --> 09:59.800
let's also specify authorization

94
10:04.320 --> 10:04.960
in value

95
10:04.960 --> 10:06.480
It's gonna be bearer

96
10:09.330 --> 10:11.280
let me go to get token

97
10:14.430 --> 10:15.380
and hit the send button.

98
10:19.990 --> 10:21.970
Let me copy the access token here

99
10:28.150 --> 10:34.990
back to this request pass it in here and then hit the send button.

100
10:39.280 --> 10:42.590
here I get error message because I did not provided the answer

101
10:42.590 --> 10:50.090
body. Let's go to body section hit  the raw option

102
10:50.130 --> 10:56.010
This is gonna be json and here let me to define the body

103
10:59.080 --> 11:01.160
this is an answer

104
11:03.040 --> 11:03.540
submitted

105
11:06.520 --> 11:08.930
from postman.

106
11:09.730 --> 11:10.860
Let's hit the send button.

107
11:14.030 --> 11:14.630
Now I get

108
11:14.660 --> 11:15.950
OK status

109
11:16.290 --> 11:26.080
success message along with new answer I just created. 
Let's save this then hit save as to duplicate the

110
11:26.080 --> 11:30.010
request. Let's rename this to update

111
11:31.180 --> 11:31.820
an answer

112
11:37.520 --> 11:40.050
and then hit this save to answers.

113
11:40.530 --> 11:49.250
Let's change the Http method to patch or put 
then change the url by specifying  the answer.

114
11:50.670 --> 11:52.710
We can grab that from here

115
11:59.530 --> 12:01.690
then in body I'll say

116
12:04.560 --> 12:08.030
I update my answer.

117
12:08.550 --> 12:09.650
Let's hit the send button

118
12:14.690 --> 12:15.200
okay

119
12:15.220 --> 12:18.340
the answer has been updated successfully.

120
12:18.340 --> 12:19.530
Let's save this request.

121
12:22.490 --> 12:27.090
And then make the last request to test delete endpoint.

122
12:27.170 --> 12:28.270
Let's save this request

123
12:30.810 --> 12:35.810
Here I'll call it as delete an answer

124
12:39.770 --> 12:42.980
and hit this save button. Then here

125
12:42.980 --> 12:52.680
let's change http method to delete and I think we 
don't need to make any change. In the body section

126
12:52.690 --> 12:59.290
we can keep it or we can optionally 
remove it by choosing this none option.

127
12:59.290 --> 13:00.370
Just hit the send button

128
13:03.230 --> 13:04.200
OK

129
13:04.230 --> 13:05.450
the answer has been removed

130
13:05.450 --> 13:08.290
successfully

131
13:08.420 --> 13:08.740
All right

132
13:08.860 --> 13:12.310
So now that we have complete endpoints for answer resource.

133
13:12.310 --> 13:18.640
So until this point we now have some endpoints for 
questions and answer resources. In the next couple of

134
13:18.640 --> 13:19.240
lessons

135
13:19.240 --> 13:25.750
we're gonna make other endpoints such as voting 
question or answer favoriting question and so on.

136
13:25.750 --> 13:26.940
So see you there.
