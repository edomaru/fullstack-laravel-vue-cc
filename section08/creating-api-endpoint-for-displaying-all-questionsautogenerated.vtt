00:00.900 --> 00:02.170
Welcome back.

1
00:02.220 --> 00:06.170
In this lesson we're gonna create our API endpoint for displaying

2
00:06.190 --> 00:07.620
all questions.

3
00:07.650 --> 00:14.280
We're also going to be looking at eloquent api resource 
and see how to implement that in building our restful

4
00:14.310 --> 00:15.560
API.

5
00:15.690 --> 00:22.320
Now since we've already had all logic regard to 
question stuff in question controller so actually to

6
00:22.320 --> 00:27.840
create api endpoints such as displaying all the questions 
showing a particular question and stuff

7
00:27.840 --> 00:36.600
like that is much much easier here we got two options.

8
00:36.690 --> 00:39.020
First we copy the existing controller

9
00:42.670 --> 00:44.350
and make some changes on it.

10
00:44.530 --> 00:51.960
For example instead of returning the view we are going 
to return json data or the second option is create

11
00:52.000 --> 00:59.290
our brand new controller in new  namespace grab the 
logic or method one by one from existing controller

12
00:59.650 --> 01:02.290
and make some changes on it.

13
01:02.320 --> 01:08.560
In this case I'm going to be choosing the second option 
just for a question controller because I think

14
01:08.560 --> 01:11.120
it's much easier for me to explain the new concept.

15
01:11.560 --> 01:16.870
You could choose the first option if you want but I highly recommend you to follow me choosing the second

16
01:16.870 --> 01:22.750
option letter we'll be using the first option for the rest of the controllers.

17
01:22.810 --> 01:30.520
All right let's go ahead and open up our terminal and here let me isolate my work today in a new branch.

18
01:37.360 --> 01:44.130
So let's create a new controller by saying: 
php artisan make:controller

19
01:44.530 --> 01:53.940
We are gonna put our API controllers in a folder 
called API so API followed by the controller name

20
01:53.950 --> 02:02.950
In this case we're gonna call it questions controller 
just like we already have in our app.

21
02:03.130 --> 02:13.660
We can specify -m followed by question model to tell artisan comment to automatically use the question

22
02:13.660 --> 02:22.600
model. Then we gonna specify the --api to tell 
artisan to generate some api methods boiler

23
02:22.600 --> 02:24.570
plate in that controller.

24
02:24.670 --> 02:32.580
Basically this flag is almost the same with resource 
flag except it excludes the create and edit method.

25
02:33.600 --> 02:34.530
Hit return.

26
02:37.690 --> 02:38.110
Next

27
02:38.380 --> 02:44.530
We need to define a new route for 
our API so let's pull open api.php

28
02:48.910 --> 02:52.090
then inside here let's define a brand new route

29
02:52.330 --> 03:00.700
which refer to our newly created controller.

30
03:00.710 --> 03:09.140
Note that all routes that we define in here will be prefixed 
by `api` without need to specify the `api` explicitly.

31
03:09.260 --> 03:15.970
So here for instance we've defined questions 
here we'll have `/api/questions`

32
03:16.400 --> 03:27.520
We can verify the routes in our terminal head back to 
our terminal then type: php artisan route:list

33
03:28.710 --> 03:34.510
--path=api all right

34
03:34.580 --> 03:35.950
Here we have three routes

35
03:37.700 --> 03:46.720
our brand new api routes that we just created 
token and user which come from here.

36
03:46.740 --> 03:50.090
Now let's pull up our old question controller

37
03:56.820 --> 03:58.680
let's copy everything inside

38
03:58.710 --> 03:59.730
this index method

39
04:03.140 --> 04:15.260
we can now open our brand new controller api question 
question controller go to index method and

40
04:15.260 --> 04:18.800
paste the code inside here.

41
04:18.800 --> 04:26.770
Here instead of returning a view now we need to return 
all of these questions in json here we can simply

42
04:26.770 --> 04:32.190
return this question variable and laravel will 
take care of the response stuff for us

43
04:36.290 --> 04:39.510
now to test this endpoint we could test in our browser.

44
04:39.650 --> 04:43.810
So let's head over to our browser and enter

45
04:43.810 --> 04:47.050
localhost eight thousand

46
04:47.060 --> 04:50.030
api questions

47
04:50.030 --> 04:51.110
So there we go

48
04:51.110 --> 04:58.450
we have a bunch of questions in json format so 
basically all `get` endpoints or endpoint that need

49
04:58.450 --> 05:06.130
get method can be tested in our browser but 
it's best practice to test all of our api endpoints

50
05:06.400 --> 05:08.780
in REST client such as postmen.

51
05:08.930 --> 05:10.230
So let's do that

52
05:10.490 --> 05:18.750
Let's head over to postman and here before I make a test request because we need to make some test requests

53
05:18.840 --> 05:20.590
for question resource

54
05:20.700 --> 05:22.940
so let's firstly create a folder here

55
05:26.610 --> 05:26.870
here

56
05:26.880 --> 05:28.790
I call it questions

57
05:34.810 --> 05:36.170
then inside this folder

58
05:36.310 --> 05:43.650
Let's create a new request let me save

59
05:43.700 --> 05:48.560
this request as display all questions

60
05:58.460 --> 06:10.720
the method is gonna be get and the URL is going to 
be as http localhost eight thousand api questions

61
06:13.620 --> 06:15.870
Now if we hit the send button

62
06:21.650 --> 06:24.230
here we'll get data back.

63
06:24.290 --> 06:24.800
All right

64
06:24.800 --> 06:31.340
so now that we have our API endpoint to display all questions let's continue the next video and learn

65
06:31.340 --> 06:33.770
about eloquent API resources.
