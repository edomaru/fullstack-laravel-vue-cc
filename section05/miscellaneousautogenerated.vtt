00:01.890 --> 00:09.000
There are a couple of things that we need to do before 
we end the section. First in the front page instead

1
00:09.000 --> 00:16.810
of showing Laravel welcome page we will display all questions.

2
00:16.930 --> 00:25.240
Second in the show question page 
we will sort all answers by votes count.

3
00:25.380 --> 00:28.230
So the answer with high votes will be displayed first

4
00:35.070 --> 00:40.500
then we will also hide these answers 
container when no answer is available

5
00:40.530 --> 00:52.180
because you see it's weird right? And the last we are 
going to show an alert when no questions available.

6
00:52.200 --> 00:57.550
All right let's go ahead and open up our terminal.

7
00:57.800 --> 01:00.910
And here we can isolate our work today in your branch.

8
01:07.940 --> 01:08.350
OK

9
01:08.350 --> 01:10.120
we start from the easiest part

10
01:10.920 --> 01:19.730
Let's open routes web.php here

11
01:20.650 --> 01:21.800
let's change the root route to

12
01:26.090 --> 01:30.160
questions controller index action.

13
01:35.930 --> 01:41.830
now if we navigate to the front page

14
01:41.960 --> 01:43.370
We see all questions displayed.

15
01:46.890 --> 01:47.280
Next

16
01:47.280 --> 01:48.660
let's go to the show question page

17
01:55.970 --> 02:00.480
and here if we open the query log

18
02:00.610 --> 02:04.620
We see in this query there is no sorting command.

19
02:04.830 --> 02:07.750
So let's sort the answers by votes count. The high

20
02:07.770 --> 02:10.980
votes answer will be display first.

21
02:10.990 --> 02:16.660
There could be many different ways to sort the 
relation model but here I'll show you just two ways.

22
02:16.660 --> 02:23.040
Let's see the first one here we can see 
that this query is came from here.

23
02:23.310 --> 02:43.620
route service provider line twenty eight. So let's open the file.

24
02:43.670 --> 02:45.670
Here we have a query to get the question

25
02:45.680 --> 02:49.290
by slug. And it has

26
02:49.310 --> 02:56.160
answers user relationship eager loaded. And the technique 
that you are going to use here is simply add the

27
02:56.160 --> 02:57.700
answer relationship model

28
02:57.820 --> 03:01.460
inside this `with` method and then specify the sorting.

29
03:04.280 --> 03:04.650
So

30
03:04.650 --> 03:06.100
let me duplicate this line.

31
03:09.730 --> 03:11.120
And I'll comment another one.

32
03:14.910 --> 03:16.550
Let's wrap the relationship in array

33
03:23.500 --> 03:25.360
then add answers as array key

34
03:30.480 --> 03:32.220
and then a closure as array value

35
03:37.650 --> 03:39.590
and it should has an argument

36
03:40.200 --> 03:41.220
let's say query.

37
03:47.870 --> 03:58.060
now inside here we simply call query and then call order 
by my method the first argument is the column name

38
03:58.180 --> 04:00.720
that will be used to sort the query.

39
04:01.030 --> 04:02.390
In this case votes count

40
04:05.530 --> 04:11.140
in a second argument is the order type. Since 
we're going to display the higher vote answer first

41
04:11.200 --> 04:12.400
that's why we specify DESC

42
04:17.650 --> 04:23.670
descending from the higher to the lower and that's it.

43
04:23.670 --> 04:24.980
Now if I reload the page

44
04:28.110 --> 04:42.060
Ups I get error I missed semicolon reload gain.

45
04:42.100 --> 04:45.380
Now you see order by votes count descending added here.

46
04:52.590 --> 05:01.370
And you see in the answer list the high votes answer display first.

47
05:01.400 --> 05:02.990
So that's the first way

48
05:02.990 --> 05:05.030
Now let's see the second one.

49
05:05.180 --> 05:07.180
Let's go back to route service provider

50
05:10.220 --> 05:11.760
and here our I'll comment this query

51
05:15.690 --> 05:17.580
and uncomment another one.

52
05:17.580 --> 05:22.590
So we revert to the previous query and we'll 
place the order by method in another place.

53
05:24.510 --> 05:26.840
Actually let's copy this order by method call 

54
05:30.950 --> 05:31.640
save the change

55
05:41.730 --> 05:46.390
and you see the order by command disapear.

56
05:46.390 --> 05:48.430
Now let's open question model

57
05:54.380 --> 05:55.880
And then find answers

58
05:55.910 --> 05:57.000
relationship method

59
06:02.670 --> 06:05.550
here after has many method calling

60
06:05.550 --> 06:17.390
we can simply paste the order by method.

61
06:17.490 --> 06:27.010
So every time we call question answers 
in all places the records will be sorted by

62
06:27.140 --> 06:28.220
votes count descendingly

63
06:34.760 --> 06:36.050
now if we reload the page

64
06:42.120 --> 06:45.720
will get the same thing.

65
06:45.730 --> 06:52.240
So if you want to do different sorting types to the relationship 
model for example in one query you want to show

66
06:52.300 --> 06:58.430
the relationship model by id ascendingly and in another 
query you want to sort it by votes count descendingly

67
06:58.510 --> 07:02.680
then you can  follow the first way.

68
07:02.860 --> 07:07.990
But if you want to perform the same sorting method 
to the relationship model in all places then you

69
07:07.990 --> 07:11.770
can do that directly in the model 
such as we did in the second way.

70
07:13.220 --> 07:18.460
Here I'll keep using the second way because I think it's much simpler than the first one and I'm sure

71
07:18.470 --> 07:28.150
all answers to the related to the question always 
be sorted by votes count descendingly. Next

72
07:28.340 --> 07:30.180
Let's hide the answers container when

73
07:30.380 --> 07:36.190
no answers found in the show question page.

74
07:36.260 --> 07:38.120
So let's switch over to our editor

75
07:41.670 --> 07:45.390
and then open answers _index.blade.php

76
07:48.640 --> 07:49.200
here

77
07:49.330 --> 07:50.280
We can simply check

78
07:54.790 --> 07:57.060
if the answers count

79
07:59.410 --> 08:00.640
is greater than zero

80
08:06.330 --> 08:08.100
and then move the rest of the code inside.

81
08:26.770 --> 08:28.130
Now if we reload the page

82
08:32.300 --> 08:36.250
the answers container disappear.

83
08:36.290 --> 08:36.740
All right

84
08:36.740 --> 08:40.920
the last thing that we're going to do is showing
an alert when no question is available.

85
08:42.730 --> 08:44.620
Let me switch over to my terminal

86
08:49.210 --> 08:55.020
and here I'll call php artisan migrate:fresh

87
08:55.380 --> 09:00.790
Remember this command will drop all tables
in database and then recreate them again.

88
09:00.860 --> 09:02.500
So we will have empty tables.

89
09:10.430 --> 09:15.250
Now if you see here there's nothing to show.

90
09:15.610 --> 09:18.960
And it's look weird that's why we need to say something here

91
09:18.970 --> 09:21.370
to our visitors so that they know what happened.

92
09:25.170 --> 09:39.390
So let's open questions index.blade.php

93
09:39.600 --> 09:41.440
And here we can change the `foreach` loop

94
09:49.090 --> 09:50.080
to `forelse`

95
09:59.490 --> 10:06.610
below here let's add empty directive.

96
10:06.820 --> 10:09.910
So when we don't have any questions we will do something

97
10:13.880 --> 10:18.160
here we simply add bootstrap alert alert warning

98
10:18.170 --> 10:18.800
In this case.

99
10:24.930 --> 10:29.150
and inside this will say "sorry

100
10:34.150 --> 10:35.590
there are no questions available"

101
10:42.510 --> 10:43.450
let's have a look.

102
10:47.940 --> 10:48.460
OK

103
10:48.540 --> 10:51.450
Now we have alert show up and I think it's much better.

104
10:55.630 --> 10:58.610
OK I'll seed my database again.

105
11:07.450 --> 11:08.430
Ups I get error.

106
11:13.250 --> 11:14.390
let me open database seed.

107
11:18.170 --> 11:20.680
apparently I forgot to add a semicolon here

108
11:36.800 --> 11:42.560
I'll reload the page.

109
11:42.610 --> 11:53.870
Now the alert disappears and all questions displayed.

110
11:53.990 --> 11:55.510
So that's pretty much it

111
11:55.790 --> 11:57.890
that's all I want to talk about here.

112
11:57.950 --> 12:00.790
Let's commit  all changes and join me in the next section.
