In a previous lesson we've implemented 
DRY principle in our models.

1
00:05.800 --> 00:08.000
Now in this lesson we are going to implement that

2
00:08.020 --> 00:17.780
in our application's views because you see here we 
wrote the same code for author info on question and

3
00:18.020 --> 00:19.580
answer repeatedly.

4
00:19.790 --> 00:28.160
Also for vote question and vote answer.

5
00:28.170 --> 00:32.950
All right let's go ahead and open our 
terminal and then create new branch

6
00:40.440 --> 00:40.800
OK

7
00:40.820 --> 00:48.890
Firstly let's open up answers index.blade.php

8
00:49.050 --> 00:50.920
and then let's find author info.

9
01:04.270 --> 01:13.550
OK here let's put these lines into other view 
and here we'll include that by saying include

10
01:16.580 --> 01:29.190
shared dot author. Here we need to pass two values 
the first one is model and it will hold the current model

11
01:29.390 --> 01:31.050
instance.

12
01:31.260 --> 01:32.610
In this case answer

13
01:37.440 --> 01:38.760
and the second is label

14
01:42.210 --> 01:49.960
and it will be answered.

15
01:49.970 --> 02:02.040
Now let's go to this folder and create new folder 
and let's call it shared as we called here

16
02:07.270 --> 02:16.950
and then inside his folder let's create new file 
and let's call it underscore author blade php

17
02:21.890 --> 02:24.320
and then inside this file just paste the code.

18
02:33.490 --> 02:38.260
Here let's replace this with label that we passed in here.

19
02:53.250 --> 02:55.230
And then let's select all answer instances

20
03:02.160 --> 03:07.360
and replace them with model. Alright let's save all changes

21
03:10.700 --> 03:13.070
and let's see if everything is working fine.

22
03:25.530 --> 03:25.890
OK

23
03:25.900 --> 03:27.550
It's working as it was.

24
03:27.550 --> 03:30.490
Now let's do something to here and here

25
03:30.490 --> 03:34.430
we also need to change the layout like we have here.

26
03:39.620 --> 03:44.360
So let's open up questions index.blade.php

27
03:51.190 --> 03:57.280
sorry I mean questions show.blade.php 
so here that we need to open

28
04:04.800 --> 04:08.510
OK here so let's remove these lines

29
04:12.110 --> 04:13.160
and then create new row

30
04:20.490 --> 04:22.060
here let's create three col-4

31
04:33.710 --> 04:34.760
and in the third column

32
04:38.240 --> 04:46.280
we can include our new view by saying include shared dot author

33
04:50.770 --> 04:57.410
the model will be question and the label will be asked

34
05:04.720 --> 05:07.110
Save that and let's see

35
05:18.150 --> 05:19.680
here the layout has changed

36
05:23.420 --> 05:28.930
and everything is fine. Now let's also 
refactor the code for this vote controls.

37
05:29.300 --> 05:38.300
As you can see in the UI we have the similar controls 
for the question and answer. The difference here

38
05:38.990 --> 05:44.270
we have favorite button only on the question and we have

39
05:47.080 --> 05:49.720
and we have accept answer button only on the answer item

40
05:58.820 --> 06:00.080
but if we see in the markup

41
06:05.380 --> 06:07.240
we find there are many differences

42
06:07.300 --> 06:16.800
in html attribute like title and then the id and action.

43
06:16.820 --> 06:17.950
So what do you think?

44
06:18.050 --> 06:23.650
Do we need to create two views for each vote question 
and vote answer or do we need to create only

45
06:23.660 --> 06:25.910
one view for both question and answer?
