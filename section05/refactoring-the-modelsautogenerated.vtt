00:02.310 --> 00:07.800
Up until this point we have our application fully 
functional we can manage our questions and manage

1
00:07.800 --> 00:09.720
answers for any questions.

2
00:09.720 --> 00:16.020
And the important part in question/answer application 
is we can vote on any questions and answers.

3
00:16.020 --> 00:18.090
I'm sure you've found many things to learn.

4
00:18.170 --> 00:23.280
You will learn a lot about laravel features and how 
to put them into practice in making real world

5
00:23.340 --> 00:24.840
application.

6
00:24.840 --> 00:30.200
But maybe you've seen that there were some repeated 
code that we wrote over and over in our application.

7
00:30.510 --> 00:35.010
And this is not a good practice in software development 
because it will make our application hard

8
00:35.010 --> 00:40.800
to develop and hard to maintain. That's why here in 
this lesson we're going to implement something

9
00:40.800 --> 00:43.520
called DRY principle.

10
00:43.530 --> 00:47.160
So as noted in Wikipedia that in software engineering

11
00:47.220 --> 00:53.580
Don't repeat yourself or DRY is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of

12
00:53.580 --> 00:59.300
software patterns replacing it with 
abstractions or repetition of some data

13
00:59.850 --> 01:02.810
using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

14
01:03.090 --> 01:09.620
So in the simple words DRY as the name says that 
we should not repeat our self in our code.

15
01:09.810 --> 01:12.140
So that's a brief intro but DRY

16
01:12.290 --> 01:14.990
now let's implement that in our code.

17
01:15.090 --> 01:18.800
All right let's head over to our terminal 
and then create new branch

18
01:26.170 --> 01:26.610
OK

19
01:26.660 --> 01:29.490
we are in lesson-23 branch.

20
01:29.510 --> 01:32.150
Now let's open user model

21
01:42.290 --> 01:47.380
here we see that the code in vote 
question and vote answer are similar.

22
01:47.510 --> 01:51.160
Why did we need to define two different methods for two similar things.

23
01:52.810 --> 02:05.450
So here in vote answer I'll cute everything except this one.

24
02:05.630 --> 02:07.530
And then I'll create another method

25
02:08.950 --> 02:11.340
let's say underscore vote

26
02:14.580 --> 02:20.400
and I'll define three arguments here. 
First argument will be relationship

27
02:24.170 --> 02:30.020
the second argument will be model 
and the third argument will be vote

28
02:34.540 --> 02:35.710
inside this method

29
02:35.710 --> 02:36.650
I'll paste the code.

30
02:39.180 --> 02:46.990
And then I'll select vote answers

31
02:47.090 --> 02:49.690
so the vote answers represent the relationship.

32
02:49.970 --> 02:58.600
So here we can replace them to 
relationship as we defined in here.

33
03:05.640 --> 03:07.650
And then let's select all answer instances

34
03:11.660 --> 03:18.110
and change them to model as we 
defined in the second argument.

35
03:21.550 --> 03:24.750
And the vote here is come from here.

36
03:25.870 --> 03:30.520
Now we can go to to vote question method

37
03:33.490 --> 03:34.250
here

38
03:34.480 --> 03:37.030
delete everything except this first line.

39
03:43.160 --> 03:51.130
and after that we can call this underscore 
vote pass in the vote questions in the first

40
03:51.150 --> 03:51.400
argument

41
03:56.090 --> 03:56.870
and then pass

42
03:56.900 --> 03:58.100
the question instance

43
03:58.100 --> 03:58.930
in the second argument

44
04:01.940 --> 04:07.040
and then vote.

45
04:07.050 --> 04:08.610
Now we can go to vote answer method

46
04:11.690 --> 04:15.930
and here we call this underscore vote pass

47
04:19.210 --> 04:20.360
in vote answers

48
04:24.190 --> 04:28.540
and then answer instance and then vote

49
04:36.950 --> 04:41.970
and because this vote method will be called just in this model

50
04:41.990 --> 04:45.230
so here we can change to private.

51
04:48.190 --> 04:48.570
All right

52
04:48.570 --> 04:54.340
let's save all changes and then let's make 
sure that everything is working fine.

53
05:34.940 --> 05:35.360
OK

54
05:35.370 --> 05:36.980
I think it's still working fine.

55
05:39.030 --> 05:45.540
Now let's refactor our code in the answer 
and question model if you open answer model

56
05:51.840 --> 05:57.970
here you'll see we have vote method 
up votes and down votes method.

57
05:59.630 --> 06:04.130
And then if you open question question model

58
06:11.910 --> 06:14.800
Here you'll see we also have the same methods.

59
06:15.060 --> 06:17.670
So let's implement DRY principle in both models

60
06:25.720 --> 06:26.890
let's cut these three methods

61
06:31.850 --> 06:38.200
and then let's go to app folder and 
inside this folder let's create new file

62
06:40.980 --> 06:47.070
and then let's call it votable trait dot php

63
06:52.510 --> 07:00.360
here let's define namespace app and define a trait

64
07:00.430 --> 07:09.590
so trait votable trait.

65
07:10.850 --> 07:15.860
And inside this let's paste the earlier methods and that's it.

66
07:15.890 --> 07:23.030
So we can image in a trait like a partial view we can 
create it and write lines of code on it and then

67
07:23.090 --> 07:25.950
we can include it in other file.

68
07:26.060 --> 07:30.370
Once it included an other file then 
the code inside it will be merged.

69
07:31.320 --> 07:32.910
Now we can go back to answer model

70
07:41.550 --> 07:54.310
and here we can include the trait in this 
answer model by saying use votable trait.

71
07:54.490 --> 08:00.660
So by doing these all methods that defined 
in the trait will be available in this model.

72
08:00.700 --> 08:02.940
Now let's do the same thing to question model.

73
08:08.320 --> 08:09.770
let's remove these methods

74
08:13.370 --> 08:23.080
and then here we include our votable 
trait by saying use votable trait

75
08:25.810 --> 08:26.200
ok

76
08:26.260 --> 08:26.900
let's save all these.

77
08:30.640 --> 08:32.480
and let's make sure that everything is working.

78
08:49.750 --> 08:50.440
Alright

79
08:50.540 --> 08:52.440
everything is still working as expected.

80
08:53.280 --> 08:56.930
So that's it for this lesson let's save our work to our git repo.

81
09:04.940 --> 09:23.140
git add all git commit -m and I'm going to say implement 
DRY principle on answer and question models.

82
09:23.510 --> 09:24.770
check out to master branch.

83
09:29.500 --> 09:32.530
and then merge to lesson-23

84
09:38.700 --> 09:41.520
then push the lesson-23 and master branch
