00:02.290 --> 00:07.960
In my opinion it's better to create only one view 
which can be shared for both question and answer.

1
00:08.160 --> 00:13.510
We can simply use if statement to determine 
which vote control that we will create

2
00:13.510 --> 00:15.140
So let me show it to you.

3
00:17.010 --> 00:17.760
Let me open thinker

4
00:20.520 --> 00:24.340
and hero I'll define a variable I'll call it model one.

5
00:27.990 --> 00:29.400
and this variable will hold

6
00:29.400 --> 00:30.190
Question instance.

7
00:35.590 --> 00:42.620
and then I'll define another variable I will 
call it model two. And this verbal will hold

8
00:42.640 --> 00:47.820
answer instance.

9
00:48.170 --> 00:53.290
Now I can check if any instance is 
instance of a particular class like this.

10
00:55.420 --> 00:58.520
Model one instance of app

11
01:02.840 --> 01:03.440
question

12
01:08.000 --> 01:14.380
here we get true because model one is instance of question.

13
01:14.600 --> 01:26.370
Now if I change to model two we'll got false because 
model two is not instance of question. But

14
01:26.480 --> 01:33.300
if we change to app answer we will got true.

15
01:34.220 --> 01:35.210
So I hope you get it.

16
01:40.220 --> 01:43.740
here in show.blade.php

17
01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
Let's fold this markup 

18
01:50.070 --> 01:51.480
and then cut

19
01:54.360 --> 01:57.360
and include another view by saying include

20
02:00.380 --> 02:17.100
shared underscore vote and then we pass model with question.

21
02:17.110 --> 02:18.880
Now we can go to shared folder

22
02:23.610 --> 02:30.430
and then create new file and let's call it _vote.blade.php.

23
02:33.350 --> 02:44.290
And here we simply paste the earlier code.

24
02:44.350 --> 02:45.130
All right

25
02:45.130 --> 02:47.020
now let's select all questions

26
03:03.430 --> 03:11.670
and then change them to model.

27
03:11.720 --> 03:13.350
Now let's change to other parts.

28
03:15.170 --> 03:19.970
Here as can see the title attribute  should be dynamic

29
03:20.210 --> 03:23.890
for example for answer vote it will be

30
03:23.930 --> 03:25.550
"The answer is useful".

31
03:25.730 --> 03:27.730
But for question vote it will be

32
03:27.740 --> 03:30.810
"The question is useful". Also the

33
03:30.890 --> 03:38.220
URI in the form action will be you start with questions for vote question and it will start with

34
03:38.310 --> 03:48.250
answers for the vote answer. And then the form id 
for vote question will be 'up-vote-question' but for

35
03:48.250 --> 03:52.350
answer it will be 'up-vote-answer'

36
03:54.950 --> 04:05.540
So here we can say if model instance of app question

37
04:19.090 --> 04:27.570
so here we'll define a variable let's say 
name and the value will be question

38
04:30.500 --> 04:32.910
and then we'll define another variable

39
04:33.020 --> 04:36.830
let's say first URI

40
04:39.910 --> 04:40.460
Segment

41
04:43.480 --> 04:46.500
and the value will be questions

42
04:48.890 --> 04:50.090
else

43
04:50.550 --> 05:00.140
Or else if model instance of app answer

44
05:03.680 --> 05:10.290
let's copy these lines

45
05:10.370 --> 05:18.790
We can change the name to answer.

46
05:18.990 --> 05:24.690
And this first URI Segment to answers.

47
05:24.750 --> 05:28.060
All right we have two variables to hold the state of the vote

48
05:33.150 --> 05:41.660
now let's select the questions in the URI.

49
05:41.840 --> 05:43.850
Here we don't to change the favourite button

50
05:49.000 --> 05:52.310
So we'll only select vote up and vote down form.

51
05:52.900 --> 05:56.310
And then let's replace them to

52
05:56.380 --> 06:05.390
first URI Segment

53
06:06.380 --> 06:11.430
Actually we can make them more simpler but that's fine for now.

54
06:11.910 --> 06:12.440
Next

55
06:17.120 --> 06:19.440
let's select all questions in the markup.

56
06:19.580 --> 06:19.950
except

57
06:19.940 --> 06:20.710
the favourite button.

58
06:28.620 --> 06:32.940
and then we can change them to name

59
06:39.320 --> 06:39.970
Now let's move

60
06:40.040 --> 06:42.770
this favourite control to another view.

61
06:42.770 --> 06:53.300
Let's select these cut and again we'll use if statement to 
make sure that the controls will be rendered in question

62
06:55.770 --> 07:02.700
if model instance of app question

63
07:09.530 --> 07:17.070
and then here we can call include shared underscore favorite

64
07:21.970 --> 07:28.200
model model

65
07:28.410 --> 07:30.890
OK now we can go to shared folder

66
07:33.760 --> 07:34.690
and create new file

67
07:38.210 --> 07:46.220
and we can call it _favorite.blade.php

68
07:46.380 --> 07:48.430
And here we just paste the code

69
07:55.480 --> 08:00.220
and then let's switch to answers _index.blade.php

70
08:07.280 --> 08:09.150
and here

71
08:09.410 --> 08:10.840
let's cut this accept answer

72
08:15.750 --> 08:29.470
back to a shared folder and create new file 
and call it _accept.blade.php and paste the

73
08:29.470 --> 08:29.910
code.

74
08:35.010 --> 08:35.780
Here let's select

75
08:35.810 --> 08:37.000
all answer

76
08:45.880 --> 08:50.370
and replace them to model.

77
08:50.480 --> 08:53.500
Now we can go back to underscore vote

78
08:53.510 --> 08:54.400
blade php

79
08:58.730 --> 09:06.450
and here let's add else if elseif model instance of

80
09:09.440 --> 09:10.040
answer

81
09:13.690 --> 09:23.630
and here can copy these lines paste here and change to shared accept

82
09:28.850 --> 09:30.380
Alright  let's save all changes. And let's

83
09:35.710 --> 09:38.590
see if everything is stil working fine.

84
09:49.750 --> 09:51.130
Let's inspect this vote up

85
09:59.460 --> 10:08.810
here you see the id is vote up question and followed 
by question id and the action is questions

86
10:08.860 --> 10:09.990
question id vote

87
10:13.590 --> 10:15.180
let me see the down vote.

88
10:19.290 --> 10:27.360
Here you see the id vote down question followed by
question id and the action questions question id

89
10:27.620 --> 10:28.600
vote.

90
10:28.800 --> 10:30.810
Now let's see the vote up and down in answer

91
10:40.030 --> 10:40.840
OK

92
10:40.890 --> 10:43.680
here the id up vote answer

93
10:43.960 --> 10:48.470
answer id and the action answers answer Id vote.

94
10:54.860 --> 10:56.030
OK down vote

95
10:56.030 --> 10:57.130
answer.

96
10:57.200 --> 11:04.260
answers answer id vote. OK great. Actually let me try them.

97
11:22.490 --> 11:23.210
OK

98
11:40.730 --> 11:41.600
OK great

99
11:41.600 --> 11:44.250
our application still working fine as it was.

100
11:49.860 --> 12:02.780
And the last thing that I want to do is here I want to 
simplify this id and this action. So let me copy

101
12:02.870 --> 12:06.930
this and select other instance

102
12:10.190 --> 12:17.880
and change them to formId and then here in the top

103
12:28.890 --> 12:33.580
I'll define a formId variable and paste the form id

104
12:36.770 --> 12:38.160
and make a little adjustment.

105
12:46.600 --> 12:47.050
And then

106
12:51.730 --> 13:00.900
I'll copy this URI and select the other instance.

107
13:01.020 --> 13:05.410
Now let's change them to forms action

108
13:09.280 --> 13:14.450
and then here let's define the form action variable

109
13:17.440 --> 13:19.380
and paste the URI

110
13:19.810 --> 13:21.250
Also make a little adjustment.

111
13:54.350 --> 14:06.140
And here I need to change this to from id

112
14:06.350 --> 14:11.380
OK so now we have successfully 
implemented DRY principle in our view.

113
14:12.010 --> 14:16.930
And you can see now or view look 
more simpler and more cleaner.

114
14:17.470 --> 14:17.770
OK

115
14:17.770 --> 14:18.520
That's it.

116
14:18.520 --> 14:21.290
Let's commit and push our changes to our git repo.
