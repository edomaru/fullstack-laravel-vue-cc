00:01.300 --> 00:07.540
In the previous lessons we have refactor our views, clean 
the content from malicious code and other stuffs.

1
00:07.720 --> 00:08.070
Now

2
00:08.070 --> 00:13.570
before we actually end this sections let's tidy up our views.

3
00:13.680 --> 00:22.050
So here we have divider between its answer 
using html horizontal rule. That's way it's

4
00:22.060 --> 00:24.470
also appear on the last answer.

5
00:24.970 --> 00:31.220
I think it's not good and we will remove it from our 
markup and then create our own divider using

6
00:31.240 --> 00:31.540
css

7
00:36.950 --> 00:42.690
we also need to move a single answer into another 
view and loop through it in foreach loop

8
00:42.770 --> 00:49.190
This will make our views much cleaner and it will 
make it more easier for us to migrate or rewrite our

9
00:49.190 --> 00:55.220
views into vue js components when we are 
integrating vue js into our application in other

10
00:55.220 --> 00:57.160
section of this course.

11
00:57.890 --> 01:00.800
All right let's open up our terminal

12
01:03.570 --> 01:08.080
and then create new branch by saying git check out

13
01:08.170 --> 01:12.730
-b lesson-27

14
01:12.950 --> 01:15.750
Now we are in new branch and we're good to go.

15
01:16.170 --> 01:19.120
OK let's open up answers

16
01:21.330 --> 01:31.100
_index.blade.php

17
01:31.340 --> 01:35.930
And here I realized that I forgot to replace 
the vote control with the vote view

18
01:38.970 --> 01:42.880
So here

19
01:42.950 --> 01:49.700
So here let me remove the vote control and include 
the vote view that is stored in shared folder.

20
01:56.670 --> 01:59.520
And then pass in the answer instance as model

21
02:06.120 --> 02:08.330
let me see if everything's still working.

22
02:20.880 --> 02:21.530
OK

23
02:21.670 --> 02:23.200
I think everything is working fine.

24
02:29.250 --> 02:29.710
Here

25
02:29.770 --> 02:34.150
let's move this answer item into another
view and then included here.

26
02:36.960 --> 02:38.460
So let's fold this

27
02:44.120 --> 02:45.110
cut

28
02:45.790 --> 02:48.820
And then we say include

29
02:51.260 --> 02:54.330
answers dot underscore

30
02:54.450 --> 02:56.450
answer.

31
02:56.690 --> 03:00.480
And then we can explicitly pass in 
the answer instance to this view

32
03:03.680 --> 03:10.390
but passing data to child view is optional because 
variables that are available in the parent view will

33
03:10.390 --> 03:12.960
be also available in the child view.

34
03:12.970 --> 03:19.870
So in this case we can omit that.

35
03:20.170 --> 03:22.210
Let's also remove this horizontal rule

36
03:24.970 --> 03:26.110
because as I said

37
03:29.600 --> 03:32.210
it also appear even in the last answer.

38
03:33.760 --> 03:40.950
So letter we'll write css code to show border 
on the bottom of the answer except the last one.

39
03:41.110 --> 03:42.070
And if we see

40
03:53.430 --> 04:00.930
the border color is rgba zero zero zero zero point 1.

41
04:00.930 --> 04:03.710
Now let's create you file inside answers folder

42
04:08.300 --> 04:13.490
and call it underscore answer blade php

43
04:16.460 --> 04:22.750
inside this file just paste the code. Let's 
save all changes and see how it look.

44
04:35.850 --> 04:42.390
Now our answers look close together because we've 
removed the horizontal rule which by default it

45
04:42.390 --> 04:47.610
has some space on the top and the bottom 
so let's switch back over to our editor

46
04:53.490 --> 04:54.850
in here

47
04:54.900 --> 05:01.080
let's add another class so that we can easily select the 
element that contains our answer when writing

48
05:01.110 --> 05:02.080
css code.

49
05:02.340 --> 05:06.880
Here I'll add post instead of answer.

50
05:06.990 --> 05:13.200
Because the class will also be used later in question 
item but it's up to you to call it whenever you

51
05:13.200 --> 05:14.150
like.

52
05:14.730 --> 05:17.720
All right let's open app dot

53
05:17.780 --> 05:18.960
s c s s

54
05:25.820 --> 05:28.930
and then the define new css rule for the post class.

55
05:39.220 --> 05:42.790
Here we need a space between one answer with another.

56
05:42.940 --> 05:45.190
So we can specify padding

57
05:45.820 --> 05:55.190
let's say 20 pixels on the top and the bottom 
and then we can define border bottom

58
06:01.390 --> 06:03.130
one pixel solid

59
06:05.570 --> 06:06.470
rgba

60
06:09.230 --> 06:19.810
black zero point one.

61
06:20.060 --> 06:27.380
Here I passed in black variable which is defined in 
bootstrap variable into rgba function. In regular

62
06:27.390 --> 06:27.930
css

63
06:28.040 --> 06:29.490
this will not work.

64
06:29.570 --> 06:33.930
You have to define a value for red green and blue instead.

65
06:34.160 --> 06:42.170
So this will work only in sass. And to prevent 
the last item to be has border bottom

66
06:42.410 --> 06:51.080
here we can utilize pseudo class not last child

67
06:54.900 --> 06:57.520
and move the border bottom inside.

68
06:58.530 --> 07:04.780
So this means all post class except 
the last child will be has border bottom.

69
07:04.860 --> 07:13.030
All right let's save all changes and let's see. Actually 
we need to compile these to see the change

70
07:20.440 --> 07:22.950
npm run watch

71
07:42.470 --> 07:42.990
OK

72
07:43.080 --> 07:46.760
Now we have border between each answer as before.

73
07:49.020 --> 07:52.140
And you can see there's no border on the bottom.

74
07:52.160 --> 07:53.790
Great.

75
07:53.800 --> 08:03.520
Now let's also apply these two the all questions page.

76
08:03.640 --> 08:05.900
Let's switch back over to our editor

77
08:09.530 --> 08:12.850
And open questions

78
08:13.200 --> 08:14.710
index.blade.php

79
08:18.300 --> 08:19.910
and then find

80
08:21.920 --> 08:22.670
forelse

81
08:32.400 --> 08:33.670
let's cut the question excerpt remove

82
08:40.760 --> 08:52.120
the horizontal rule then here we can say include questions dot underscore excerpt

83
08:56.250 --> 09:02.680
and then go to questions folder and create new file.

84
09:02.860 --> 09:07.720
Let's call it _excerpt.blade.php

85
09:12.220 --> 09:14.130
and then paste the code here.

86
09:18.240 --> 09:21.650
And don't forget to add post class here.

87
09:21.760 --> 09:24.140
Let's save all changes and have a look.

88
09:37.930 --> 09:40.490
The last item still has border

89
09:40.840 --> 09:41.620
let me see

90
09:44.700 --> 09:47.330
OK here I need to remove this

91
10:00.490 --> 10:01.190
OK

92
10:01.200 --> 10:02.940
Now look good.

93
10:03.090 --> 10:04.620
Now let me show the pagination.

94
10:16.610 --> 10:17.560
Here

95
10:17.590 --> 10:20.460
I'll change the number to five.

96
10:29.680 --> 10:30.070
Here

97
10:30.070 --> 10:36.290
the problem is the pagination has no space 
on the top and it close to the last item.

98
10:36.360 --> 10:45.410
So let's switch back over to our editor and then go to resources.

99
10:47.770 --> 10:53.590
views vendor pagination folder

100
10:53.950 --> 10:55.600
and then let's open bootstrap 4

101
10:55.630 --> 10:56.490
blade php.

102
10:59.350 --> 11:00.360
And here

103
11:00.370 --> 11:01.930
let's add margin top

104
11:01.970 --> 11:03.420
I'll try mt-3

105
11:11.370 --> 11:17.910
is still too close I think so here I'll try mt-4

106
11:23.410 --> 11:23.910
OK

107
11:23.930 --> 11:29.440
I think it's much better. Let me change back to 10

108
11:35.910 --> 11:42.430
all right so now we have our views much cleaner 
and I think we are ready to go to the next section

109
11:42.700 --> 11:48.040
to learn about vue js integration to 
make our application more interactive.

110
11:48.100 --> 11:53.000
So please commit your changes to your git repo and join me in the next section.
