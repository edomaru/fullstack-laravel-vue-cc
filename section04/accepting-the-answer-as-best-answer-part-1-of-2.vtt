00:02.500 --> 00:05.890
In this lesson we are going to add new feature to our application

1
00:05.900 --> 00:08.350
that allows the creator of the question to accept

2
00:08.350 --> 00:14.410
the particular answer as the best answer. I'm sure you've 
already know the logic behind his future because

3
00:14.410 --> 00:15.310
we went over it in

4
00:15.310 --> 00:17.320
the previous section of this course.

5
00:17.320 --> 00:22.990
But now we will implement that logic and 
make this accept button works.

6
00:23.010 --> 00:25.080
All right let's head over to our terminal

7
00:29.250 --> 00:42.050
and here let's create new branch by saying: 
git checkout -b lesson-20.

8
00:42.070 --> 00:47.800
Now let's open answers underscore index.blade.php

9
00:50.900 --> 01:05.920
and then go to accept button. Here the button

10
01:12.920 --> 01:15.280
So here we'll need a form and submit it

11
01:15.350 --> 01:20.600
when the creator of the question hitting this button.

12
01:20.780 --> 01:24.550
So here let me put this to a new line.

13
01:32.000 --> 01:34.070
And here we can say on click

14
01:36.860 --> 01:39.900
and firstly we need to stop the default action of this anchor

15
01:40.300 --> 01:47.060
by calling event prevent default.

16
01:47.620 --> 01:55.100
And then we need to select the element or the form 
in this case we can do that with saying document

17
01:55.500 --> 02:03.310
get element by id. the id is going to be

18
02:06.980 --> 02:09.460
accept answer

19
02:12.260 --> 02:16.220
and concatenate with ID of the answer to make the form unique.

20
02:27.630 --> 02:43.310
And after we have selected a form we can submit it.

21
02:43.320 --> 02:45.220
Now here we can define the form

22
02:45.390 --> 02:57.030
so form the id will be accept answer followed by answer's id

23
03:02.680 --> 03:04.390
and this should be match

24
03:08.990 --> 03:10.100
with this

25
03:21.280 --> 03:23.500
and then the action will be route

26
03:26.400 --> 03:32.070
answers dot accept and pass the answer ID

27
03:39.760 --> 03:41.560
and last the method will be post

28
03:46.970 --> 03:47.910
close the form.

29
03:54.790 --> 03:58.200
Actually here we need to make sure that the form is hidden

30
03:58.330 --> 04:13.070
by specify style and inside it we'll say display none.

31
04:13.990 --> 04:22.400
Also don't forget to add csrf token by saying `csrf` directive

32
04:22.510 --> 04:23.240
All right

33
04:23.240 --> 04:32.140
Now let's define this answers dot accept route. 
Let's open routes web.php

34
04:43.450 --> 04:50.520
and here let's define a new route by saying 
route double colons post

35
04:50.620 --> 04:55.830
the uri is going to be answers

36
04:56.110 --> 05:08.900
answer accept and the action is going to be 
accept answer controller

37
05:09.410 --> 05:10.130
just like this

38
05:15.030 --> 05:17.540
the name will be answers

39
05:18.510 --> 05:19.330
dot accept

40
05:27.690 --> 05:35.100
so ideally we need to specify what method in here 
such as store edit or whatever

41
05:35.100 --> 05:41.760
but for now I'll introduce you about single action controller so as the name suggest single action controller

42
05:42.000 --> 05:43.350
is a controller

43
05:43.530 --> 05:45.430
that only handle a single action.

44
05:45.740 --> 05:51.000
And because we only have a single action in the controller here we don't need to specify the action

45
05:51.000 --> 05:52.380
name.

46
05:52.410 --> 06:01.910
Now let's create the accept answer controller using 
artisan. Head over to our terminal and here we can

47
06:01.910 --> 06:13.420
say: `php artisan make:controller AcceptAnswerController`

48
06:18.960 --> 06:21.540
alright let's opened the accept answer controller

49
06:30.680 --> 06:33.270
here let's important the namespace of the answer model

50
06:44.090 --> 06:53.940
and here we should define our action name as 
double underscore invoke.

51
06:54.150 --> 06:58.620
And here we can also define an argument and type-hint to answer.

52
07:06.950 --> 07:07.770
Inside here

53
07:07.780 --> 07:09.220
for now let's show a message

54
07:17.470 --> 07:18.090
so

55
07:21.570 --> 07:27.870
when we define the action like this without any method 
name laravel will be assume that the method will

56
07:27.870 --> 07:32.500
be called is this invoke method.

57
07:34.520 --> 07:36.670
All right let's save all changes

58
07:38.130 --> 07:56.140
and let's see if it works as we expect.

59
07:56.180 --> 07:57.620
Let's find our own question

60
08:09.830 --> 08:12.620
and here let's randomly accept the answer as best answer

61
08:17.820 --> 08:19.180
Ups I get error

62
08:24.780 --> 08:25.770
let me see the token

63
08:34.660 --> 08:41.470
here I made typo.

64
08:41.670 --> 08:52.470
This should be csrf save reload again.

65
09:02.950 --> 09:04.050
Now I have the token here

66
09:07.540 --> 09:09.280
let me hit this button once again.

67
09:11.310 --> 09:11.650
All right

68
09:11.650 --> 09:16.560
here we have accept the answer message show up.

69
09:16.720 --> 09:19.680
Now let's go back to invoke method.

70
09:21.570 --> 09:23.360
And here let's remove this line

71
09:23.980 --> 09:29.860
and here we can accept the answer as best answer by 
modify the best_answer_id in the question model. We

72
09:30.040 --> 09:33.410
will encapsulate that logic in the question model.

73
09:33.770 --> 09:43.250
And here we can say answer question accept best answer

74
09:46.080 --> 09:47.320
and pass in the answer

75
09:47.570 --> 09:48.320
instance

76
09:53.160 --> 09:55.620
So we will create this method shortly

77
09:55.800 --> 10:01.790
but for now let's refresh the page by saying return back.

78
10:01.950 --> 10:06.780
And in this case I think we don't need to show any flash message.

79
10:06.780 --> 10:11.690
So we only need just this common. All right

80
10:11.730 --> 10:14.930
the last thing that we should do is define this

81
10:14.950 --> 10:18.580
Accept best answer method in our question model.

82
10:19.030 --> 10:21.070
So let's open the question model

83
10:31.340 --> 10:31.750
and here

84
10:31.760 --> 10:44.750
let's create new method so public function accepts 
best answer and provide an argument

85
10:45.060 --> 10:46.290
answer instance in this case

86
10:52.030 --> 10:57.580
inside this method we simply call this best answer

87
10:58.980 --> 11:03.150
id equals answer

88
11:03.460 --> 11:05.730
id

89
11:06.520 --> 11:09.520
and then we can call this save

90
11:12.330 --> 11:12.820
alright

91
11:12.880 --> 11:13.870
let's save all changes

92
11:18.920 --> 11:36.980
and here we have request submitted so 
we can simply reload a page and hit continue.

93
11:37.060 --> 11:37.700
All right

94
11:37.700 --> 11:42.870
here we can see the answer is green color which mean 
it has been accepted as best answer

95
11:42.920 --> 11:45.040
Great.

96
11:45.280 --> 11:46.460
Let me click another answer

97
11:56.870 --> 11:59.200
and now the best answer changing to this one.
