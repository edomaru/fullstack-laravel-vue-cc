All right the last thing that we need to do is to authorize 
this accept answer button because as you

1
00:08.030 --> 00:13.110
remember only the user that created the question 
can accept the particular answer

2
00:13.130 --> 00:14.850
as best answer right?

3
00:14.930 --> 00:28.190
So let's go back to our editor and re-open answer policy.

4
00:28.650 --> 00:30.180
Let's duplicate the existing method

5
00:35.740 --> 00:39.910
and then change this to let's say accept

6
00:44.110 --> 00:49.670
here we need to match the current user ID with the user ID that create the question.

7
00:49.690 --> 00:57.570
So here we can change the right side to answer question

8
00:58.160 --> 01:00.680
user id

9
01:00.930 --> 01:02.690
Now let's go back to accept

10
01:02.700 --> 01:03.570
Answer controller

11
01:06.300 --> 01:22.660
and here we can authorize this action by saying this authorize accept answer.

12
01:22.700 --> 01:26.300
Finally let's go back to underscore index.blade.php

13
01:31.070 --> 01:34.680
and here we can check if the current user can accept the answer

14
01:54.630 --> 01:55.600
save all changes

15
02:00.110 --> 02:00.770
here

16
02:00.820 --> 02:01.780
Let's reload the page

17
02:08.070 --> 02:08.400
here

18
02:08.470 --> 02:10.690
the accept button still appear

19
02:11.250 --> 02:13.110
Now let's go back to all questions

20
02:19.060 --> 02:21.510
and find the question that owned by other user

21
02:30.970 --> 02:37.110
as you can see the accept control is hidden. 
Actually here we need to show the green check

22
02:37.150 --> 02:41.530
icon only to the answer that has been accepted as best answer

23
02:41.780 --> 02:47.840
so that anyone that see this question can know which 
answer that has been accepted as best answer.

24
02:48.010 --> 03:01.480
So let me go back to previous question.

25
03:01.590 --> 03:04.130
So this question is created by current user

26
03:04.260 --> 03:06.820
and here an answer has been accepted as best

27
03:06.840 --> 03:07.780
answer

28
03:07.860 --> 03:10.300
So as I said we need to show the green check

29
03:10.350 --> 03:15.360
icon to mark this answer as best answer 
to anyone that see this question.

30
03:15.990 --> 03:18.240
So to do that let's go back to our editor

31
03:21.450 --> 03:23.850
and here we can

32
03:23.850 --> 03:32.440
add `else` which means the user is not the 
authenticated to accept this answer.

33
03:32.440 --> 03:33.070
Inside this

34
03:33.070 --> 03:38.750
we can add if statement to check if the answer is accepted as

35
03:38.760 --> 03:40.190
best answer or not.

36
03:52.190 --> 03:52.790
If yes

37
03:52.960 --> 03:54.360
then we can show the green check

38
03:54.350 --> 04:00.970
icon. Here we can simply copy this and paste here.

39
04:03.930 --> 04:08.950
And then let's change the title

40
04:09.020 --> 04:09.800
let's say

41
04:13.510 --> 04:15.470
the question owner

42
04:17.960 --> 04:20.300
accepted accepted this

43
04:20.300 --> 04:21.010
Answer as best

44
04:21.100 --> 04:22.120
answer

45
04:23.450 --> 04:27.710
And then we don't need this on click

46
04:28.230 --> 04:30.200
so let's remove it.

47
04:36.040 --> 04:36.680
OK

48
04:36.950 --> 04:41.720
now we can go back to answer model and define this accessor

49
04:51.460 --> 04:52.900
here let's define new accessor

50
04:56.080 --> 05:00.930
get is best attribute.

51
05:04.930 --> 05:10.560
Here the logic for this accessor is almost 
the same with this get status attribute

52
05:10.560 --> 05:11.850
So let me cut this

53
05:19.990 --> 05:24.160
and change to return

54
05:24.160 --> 05:29.390
this is best

55
05:29.500 --> 05:32.950
And here I can define another method

56
05:35.210 --> 05:37.610
Is best

57
05:39.710 --> 05:43.510
and simply say return and paste the previous code.

58
05:45.380 --> 05:50.180
Now here in this accessor we can simply say return

59
05:50.300 --> 05:56.070
this is best like so.

60
05:56.120 --> 05:56.660
All right

61
05:56.670 --> 06:00.370
let's save all changes.

62
06:00.430 --> 06:02.640
Sorry I have double `return` here.

63
06:05.420 --> 06:06.570
Save.

64
06:07.200 --> 06:14.880
Now let's make sure everything is working as it was.

65
06:15.110 --> 06:16.360
Whoops I got error.

66
06:17.500 --> 06:22.260
end for each

67
06:22.380 --> 06:23.060
Let me see

68
06:25.870 --> 06:26.720
OK here

69
06:27.860 --> 06:33.580
It should be `@endif` save reload again.

70
06:39.260 --> 06:43.220
OK it's working as it was. Now let me copy

71
06:43.230 --> 06:48.510
this url and then I'll open

72
06:51.220 --> 06:52.100
Incognito window

73
06:57.600 --> 06:59.970
and paste the url here.

74
07:08.470 --> 07:13.900
As you can see the green check icon appears 
to indicate that this answer is accepted.

75
07:13.930 --> 07:15.560
Now let me see another question.

76
07:30.430 --> 07:32.130
And here we don't see the green check

77
07:32.130 --> 07:35.200
icon because none of this answer has been accepted.

78
07:35.190 --> 07:35.900
as best answer.

79
07:42.470 --> 07:42.940
All right

80
07:42.950 --> 07:48.440
We have successfully added a new feature to our application that allows the creator or owner of the

81
07:48.440 --> 07:50.880
question to accept the particular answer

82
07:50.920 --> 07:54.750
as best answer. Now you can save your changes to your git repo

83
07:54.890 --> 07:57.680
take a quick break and then go to the next lesson.
