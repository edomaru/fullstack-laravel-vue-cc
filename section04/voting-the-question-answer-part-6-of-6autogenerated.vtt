WEBVTT

0
00:04.070 --> 00:09.320
After that we have successfully made 
our vote question controls working

1
00:09.530 --> 00:14.260
now we can do almost the same steps 
to make the vote answer control working.

2
00:14.390 --> 00:35.520
But before we moving on let's commit our 
changes into git repo git add all git commit -m 

3
00:36.790 --> 00:39.270
And then I'll push the current branch to remote repo

4
00:52.470 --> 00:55.410
and now we can switch to web.php

5
00:58.140 --> 01:00.890
and here let's define a new route for our vote answer

6
01:00.910 --> 01:24.670
button. So route post the uri will be answers answer vote 
and the action will be vote answer controller. Now let's

7
01:24.780 --> 01:36.240
go back to our terminal and create new controller 
by saying php artisan make controller vote

8
01:36.420 --> 01:38.580
answer controller

9
01:43.040 --> 01:43.450
OK

10
01:43.460 --> 01:47.920
now let's open vote answer controller

11
01:51.610 --> 01:52.950
import the answer namespace

12
02:00.130 --> 02:01.500
and then define a constructor

13
02:09.100 --> 02:10.140
and call middleware auth

14
02:18.360 --> 02:19.190
and then let's define

15
02:19.200 --> 02:19.960
invoke method

16
02:23.710 --> 02:25.000
type-hint the answer

17
02:30.240 --> 02:31.760
and here get the vote request

18
02:40.630 --> 02:42.010
and then get the current user

19
02:46.450 --> 02:51.330
then call vote answer pass in answer instance

20
02:54.250 --> 02:55.450
and also the vote

21
03:00.580 --> 03:06.470
and the last reload the page

22
03:06.760 --> 03:09.630
So here we haven't defined vote answer yet

23
03:09.820 --> 03:11.650
so let's open the user model

24
03:20.500 --> 03:24.370
and here let's define a new method vote

25
03:24.400 --> 03:24.900
answer

26
03:28.450 --> 03:40.110
answer answer and then vote

27
03:40.350 --> 03:45.770
And here the logic for this method is 
almost the same with vote question

28
03:45.810 --> 03:50.100
for now we are going to copy from this vote question

29
03:56.240 --> 03:57.550
and then we'll make some adjusment

30
04:01.900 --> 04:08.470
first less change all vote questions inside this method to 
vote answers here we can simply select an instance

31
04:10.480 --> 04:14.540
and then hit Control D to select other instances.

32
04:20.420 --> 04:30.670
Now we can change them to vote answers 
and then select the question instance

33
04:39.240 --> 04:48.490
and change them to answer.

34
04:48.620 --> 04:49.080
All right

35
04:49.140 --> 04:51.720
I think that's all we need to do here for now.

36
04:51.720 --> 04:55.200
Later we'll refactor our code and implement DRY principle.

37
04:55.350 --> 05:03.040
But for now we just make everything work and 
here we need to define down vote and up votes

38
05:06.060 --> 05:23.250
Let's simply copy them in our question model.

39
05:23.280 --> 05:23.810
All right

40
05:24.000 --> 05:32.720
now let's switch to questions show.blade.php

41
05:32.970 --> 05:37.210
And here we have vote controls fully working

42
05:37.230 --> 05:38.720
So let's copy them

43
05:47.040 --> 05:50.460
now let's open answers

44
05:51.090 --> 06:00.880
index.blade.php

45
06:01.030 --> 06:02.520
And here we can replace all of these

46
06:08.630 --> 06:09.650
here let's change

47
06:09.690 --> 06:18.350
the title from this question to this answer.

48
06:19.910 --> 06:22.970
And then change the ID from

49
06:25.730 --> 06:26.990
vote question

50
06:31.240 --> 06:37.970
to vote answer and then

51
06:42.460 --> 06:45.160
select the select the question

52
06:50.980 --> 06:53.580
and then chance them to answer

53
06:57.080 --> 07:01.770
and don't forget to change the action from questions

54
07:05.320 --> 07:08.230
to answers.

55
07:11.780 --> 07:13.050
OK that's it

56
07:13.070 --> 07:14.150
now let's save all changes.

57
07:18.330 --> 07:19.520
Switch to our browser reload

58
07:22.640 --> 07:23.450
the page

59
07:34.950 --> 07:36.510
let me go to all questions

60
07:39.460 --> 07:40.790
and see another question.

61
07:50.640 --> 07:53.550
OK I have a problem here.

62
07:53.550 --> 07:56.910
The vote counts always three

63
07:57.070 --> 07:59.560
Actually we need to seed the vote answer. 

64
08:00.040 --> 08:01.840
So let's switch over to our editor

65
08:04.630 --> 08:06.940
let's open votables table seeder

66
08:13.650 --> 08:17.100
And here let's remove all records from votables table

67
08:17.100 --> 08:18.910
so here let's remove this where method.

68
08:25.810 --> 08:27.660
And then we can copy this for each loop

69
08:32.310 --> 08:33.180
paste here.

70
08:35.170 --> 08:38.690
And change the question to answer change

71
08:42.330 --> 08:43.430
the question instance

72
08:46.580 --> 08:58.670
to answer and then change this vote question to vote answer.

73
08:58.950 --> 09:05.870
Lastly let's open answer answer factory

74
09:06.850 --> 09:09.190
And here let's comment this line.

75
09:09.980 --> 09:20.350
Save all changes go to our terminal and 
then rerun our votables table seeder

76
09:30.860 --> 09:34.550
Ups I get error class answer not found.

77
09:35.060 --> 09:41.290
OK here I need to import the namespace here.

78
09:47.300 --> 09:50.890
Save run the seed again.

79
09:53.830 --> 09:57.520
I still get the error down votes doesn't exist.

80
10:06.050 --> 10:12.980
Let's see the user model

81
10:13.020 --> 10:21.510
Sorry this should be an answer model.

82
10:24.270 --> 10:32.410
Paste here save run the seed again. OK

83
10:32.430 --> 10:34.390
no error.

84
10:34.430 --> 10:37.170
Let's see reload

85
10:41.410 --> 10:42.280
OK

86
10:42.590 --> 10:50.660
Here the number was changed.

87
10:50.750 --> 10:53.920
Now let's try to hit this vote up

88
11:00.460 --> 11:01.970
It's look no different

89
11:01.990 --> 11:03.970
So let me hit this button

90
11:11.350 --> 11:12.800
and now the numbers decreasing.

91
11:12.810 --> 11:14.280
So let me hit this button again

92
11:20.670 --> 11:25.560
and now the vote increasing and I think they are working perfectly.

93
11:25.560 --> 11:27.020
Great

94
11:27.080 --> 11:30.500
All right so now we have vote control system that really working

95
11:30.620 --> 11:34.340
we can vote up or vote down whether the question or answer.

96
11:34.360 --> 11:39.420
We are also able to favorite the question 
and accept the answer as the best answer.

97
11:40.690 --> 11:41.830
OK with that

98
11:41.920 --> 11:43.420
Let's switch over to our terminal

99
11:46.320 --> 11:53.380
and commit the changes to our git repo git

100
11:53.680 --> 12:01.690
commit -m  and I'm going to say "make the vote answer working"

101
12:05.260 --> 12:05.670
now

102
12:05.680 --> 12:06.940
I'll switch to master branch

103
12:12.380 --> 12:14.150
and merge to lesson 22 branch

104
12:21.490 --> 12:25.390
and then push the lesson 22 and 
master branch to my remote repo.
