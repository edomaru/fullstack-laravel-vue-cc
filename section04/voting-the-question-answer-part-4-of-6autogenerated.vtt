Now before we actually apply these in one application 
and make the vote question controls working

1
00:08.160 --> 00:12.860
let's apply these in new seeder and 
make fake voting to all questions.

2
00:12.900 --> 00:14.550
So let's head over to our terminal

3
00:21.490 --> 00:22.960
and then here let's create new sider

4
00:28.110 --> 00:30.290
here I'm going to call it votable

5
00:33.360 --> 00:44.220
table seeder.

6
00:44.250 --> 00:46.910
Now we can open database seeder

7
00:52.130 --> 00:53.070
and then call it here

8
01:00.590 --> 01:04.360
and then let's open votable

9
01:04.790 --> 01:05.510
table seeder

10
01:08.360 --> 01:11.750
import the namespace of user and question model here

11
01:29.400 --> 01:32.040
and here we'll do almost the same thing as we did before.

12
01:32.160 --> 01:36.400
So let's reset the votables table before we insert some records.

13
01:47.000 --> 01:52.230
Here we need to make sure that we only 
delete the records only for question.

14
01:52.250 --> 01:55.070
That's why we need to call where

15
01:59.380 --> 02:00.160
votable type

16
02:02.820 --> 02:03.880
App

17
02:04.160 --> 02:04.640
Question.

18
02:09.920 --> 02:10.410
Next

19
02:10.490 --> 02:17.940
let's get all users. We will not call pluck method 
because we need user instances in this case.

20
02:18.990 --> 02:25.410
So here we call user all to return all collections of user instance.

21
02:31.680 --> 02:33.890
And here we'll define another variable

22
02:33.890 --> 02:47.980
let's say number of users and here we can say user 
count and then let's also define a variable that

23
02:47.980 --> 03:00.190
hold the possible votes values votes equals -1 and 1.

24
03:00.230 --> 03:07.400
So when we want to vote down we can say votes zero.

25
03:08.180 --> 03:11.630
And to vote up we can say votes 1

26
03:17.220 --> 03:18.090
OK

27
03:18.340 --> 03:20.740
next let's iterate all questions in for each

28
03:33.360 --> 03:41.790
here every single question will be voted up or be 
voted down by at least one randomly and we can do

29
03:41.790 --> 03:43.410
almost same thing as we did before

30
03:59.700 --> 04:12.290
actually I'll chance this to one so that the question 
can be voted at least by one user. Inside

31
04:12.290 --> 04:16.580
here let's get the random user and assign to a variable

32
04:26.650 --> 04:28.410
after we've got the user

33
04:28.420 --> 04:37.200
then we can make that user to vote the 
question by saying user vote questions.

34
04:38.700 --> 04:47.610
Sorry vote question pass the question instance and 
here it will be vote up or vote down randomly

35
04:57.490 --> 05:07.580
Alright, the last step before we run the 
seed is to open question factory.

36
05:07.700 --> 05:10.000
And here we don't need this random vote anymore.

37
05:10.010 --> 05:13.470
So here I'll just comment this line. OK

38
05:13.640 --> 05:14.780
now let's save all changes

39
05:18.600 --> 05:19.980
and then go to our terminal

40
05:23.340 --> 05:38.540
and here let's run the votes table seeder.

41
05:38.550 --> 05:41.520
All right let me see the vote records in phpmyadmin

42
05:46.910 --> 05:49.010
here I have 14 records.

43
05:51.350 --> 05:55.920
Let me let me show only question

44
06:21.960 --> 06:32.980
OK here you can see the question one has two votes.
The question two just one vote question 5

45
06:33.350 --> 06:36.140
three votes and so on.

46
06:36.670 --> 06:37.780
Okay great

47
06:37.780 --> 06:41.290
now it's time to apply that and make 
our vote control actually working.
