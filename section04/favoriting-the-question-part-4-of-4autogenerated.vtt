00:01.490 --> 00:09.140
To make this favorite button working let's firstly define 
a new routes in routes/web.php file let's open 

1
00:09.140 --> 00:09.770
that file

2
00:17.140 --> 00:18.630
and here let's define a new route

3
00:18.730 --> 00:20.480
that's going to be used for favoriting

4
00:20.490 --> 00:27.400
the question here we can say route post

5
00:27.680 --> 00:30.730
There uri will be questions

6
00:30.820 --> 00:31.500
question

7
00:34.530 --> 00:35.060
favorites

8
00:38.370 --> 00:46.290
and we'll handle the logic in favorites controller store action

9
00:51.970 --> 00:57.380
and we might give this route a name as questions favorite.

10
01:02.440 --> 01:08.200
And then let's define another route that's going to be used to unfavorite the question. Here we can simply

11
01:08.200 --> 01:13.100
duplicate this line.

12
01:13.690 --> 01:21.720
The method will be delete because we'll remove the 
resource and I'm going to use the same uri

13
01:25.450 --> 01:28.690
we'll handle the logic in the favorites controller destroy action

14
01:32.780 --> 01:39.990
and we might give this route a name as questions unfavorite.

15
01:40.000 --> 01:45.390
All right let's create this favorites controller jump to our terminal.

16
01:45.820 --> 01:53.250
And here we can say: php artisan 
make controller favorites controller

17
01:59.280 --> 01:59.580
OK

18
01:59.620 --> 02:01.510
let's open the favorites controller file

19
02:11.970 --> 02:12.450
and in here

20
02:12.450 --> 02:14.050
Let's first define the store method

21
02:20.530 --> 02:21.870
type-hint the question instance

22
02:29.250 --> 02:39.850
here we can attach the question or make it to be 
favorited by current user by saying question favorites

23
02:43.370 --> 02:48.640
attach auth id

24
02:52.930 --> 02:56.560
after that we can refresh the page by calling return back

25
03:00.590 --> 03:02.590
the second let's defend the destroy method

26
03:08.880 --> 03:16.550
type-hint the question instance

27
03:16.660 --> 03:30.350
and here we can remove the relationship record by saying question favorites detach auth id

28
03:33.090 --> 03:37.450
and don't forget to reload the page.

29
03:39.420 --> 03:50.480
And here we need to import the namespace of the question model

30
03:50.740 --> 03:53.750
The last but not least we also need to define a constructor

31
04:04.340 --> 04:10.190
and here we'll call authentication middleware to make 
sure that the user that will favorite or unfavorite

32
04:10.190 --> 04:11.630
the question has signed in

33
04:22.230 --> 04:23.120
and the final step

34
04:23.210 --> 04:25.640
let's go back to show.blade.php

35
04:33.830 --> 04:38.360
and here we can distinguish the state of this 
button by changing its color dynamically.

36
04:44.910 --> 04:46.950
So if the user has not signed in

37
04:52.950 --> 04:54.830
then we'll add off class

38
04:59.200 --> 05:04.540
otherwise if the current user has signed in 
and he has favorited the current question

39
05:11.770 --> 05:21.870
then we'll add favorited class or we'll add nothing if 
the current user not favorited the current question.

40
05:23.140 --> 05:27.490
Next to make this favorite button actually 
work we need to do two things.

41
05:27.490 --> 05:30.740
First we need to define on click attributes. Actually

42
05:30.900 --> 05:32.590
let's copy that from the accept button

43
05:49.690 --> 05:57.700
paste here and change the id to favorite

44
05:58.120 --> 06:04.710
question and change this to question id

45
06:10.670 --> 06:11.500
the second let's

46
06:11.640 --> 06:16.820
define a form. And again we can simply 
copy the form from the accept control

47
06:30.680 --> 06:31.300
paste here

48
06:34.960 --> 06:43.240
change the id to favorite question

49
06:44.260 --> 06:45.040
question id

50
06:48.220 --> 06:54.730
and here we'll use this form for two purposes favorite the question and unfavorite the question.  Since we have

51
06:54.730 --> 07:00.740
defined the same uri pattern for favoriting 
and unfavoriting the question

52
07:00.860 --> 07:05.520
So here

53
07:06.550 --> 07:26.200
So here we can specify the uri instead of route name.

54
07:26.340 --> 07:31.140
And here we can check if the current question is 
favorited then will we define delete method

55
07:52.310 --> 07:53.910
all right let's save all changes

56
07:57.340 --> 08:01.250
and see if it work as we expect

57
08:01.330 --> 08:02.470
Let me reload this page

58
08:07.580 --> 08:07.860
here

59
08:07.870 --> 08:10.650
I have this button in light gray color.

60
08:10.960 --> 08:11.980
So let me see

61
08:14.860 --> 08:15.610
OK

62
08:15.840 --> 08:18.330
This should be auth guest

63
08:23.760 --> 08:24.580
reload again.

64
08:30.020 --> 08:35.480
Here the button in yellow color which means 
the current user has favorited this question.

65
08:35.540 --> 08:37.130
Now if I hit this button

66
08:42.670 --> 08:48.360
the button's color changed and the favorites count is decreasing.

67
08:48.510 --> 08:49.350
If I hit this again

68
08:54.860 --> 09:00.380
the color turns to yellow and the favorites count increasing.

69
09:00.420 --> 09:02.080
Let me see another question.

70
09:12.120 --> 09:13.110
And then I'll hit this button

71
09:18.170 --> 09:19.310
OK great.

72
09:20.800 --> 09:24.700
Let me copy this url and I'll open

73
09:27.770 --> 09:29.000
incognito window

74
09:35.740 --> 09:36.690
paste here.

75
09:43.520 --> 09:48.640
As you can see the favorite button's color 
a bit light gray. And if I hit this button

76
09:53.000 --> 09:54.350
I'll be taken to the login form

77
10:01.200 --> 10:02.060
OK great

78
10:02.220 --> 10:08.100
We have successfully implemented many to many 
relationship and make the favorite button really working.

79
10:08.100 --> 10:13.200
Let's take a break and we'll continue our journey and add another feature to our application in a next

80
10:13.200 --> 10:14.490
lesson.
