00:03.130 --> 00:05.190
All right let's switch over to our terminal

1
00:06.700 --> 00:08.530
And here let's generate new controller

2
00:13.350 --> 00:17.580
here it's going to be vote question controller

3
00:23.650 --> 00:24.080
OK

4
00:24.200 --> 00:26.850
Let's open vote

5
00:27.360 --> 00:28.710
Question controller.

6
00:36.680 --> 00:45.550
Let's import the question model namespace

7
00:46.750 --> 00:49.650
and here let's firstly define a constructor.

8
00:57.770 --> 01:02.720
And here we need to call auth middleware because 
a user that's going to vote needs to sign in

9
01:15.580 --> 01:24.620
and then we can define in invoke method define an 
argument which type-hint to question instance.

10
01:31.220 --> 01:37.770
and hear let's capture the vote by calling laravel 
request helper function and then vote

11
01:41.760 --> 01:43.710
and then we can assign it into a variable

12
01:47.160 --> 01:49.830
here I want to make sure that the vote is integer.

13
01:55.520 --> 01:59.290
Next we need to get the current answer and we can do by calling

14
01:59.500 --> 02:01.370
laravel auth helper

15
02:04.130 --> 02:05.210
and then call user

16
02:05.210 --> 02:10.330
method to actually get the current user instance.

17
02:11.100 --> 02:17.280
And then we can call vote question pass in 
the question instance in the first argument.

18
02:20.060 --> 02:25.760
And then pass the vote which we capture 
from the request in the second argument.

19
02:29.040 --> 02:37.600
And lastly we can refresh the page we're calling return back.

20
02:37.640 --> 02:40.460
Now we can open web.php

21
02:45.200 --> 02:49.580
and here we define a new route for voting the question.

22
02:49.580 --> 03:00.380
And here we can say route post the uri will be questions question

23
03:02.310 --> 03:09.090
vote and the handler is vote question

24
03:09.230 --> 03:13.120
controller

25
03:13.270 --> 03:15.440
Here we are using a single action controller

26
03:15.520 --> 03:17.830
So here we don't need to specify the method.

27
03:20.700 --> 03:24.000
Lastly let's open question

28
03:26.830 --> 03:28.040
show.blade.php

29
03:33.040 --> 03:38.310
here let's add off class if the user hasn't sign in.

30
03:38.420 --> 03:39.500
We can do that like this

31
03:58.950 --> 04:02.390
here we can copy this on click

32
04:12.910 --> 04:13.910
and paste here.

33
04:21.920 --> 04:25.040
And then change the id to

34
04:28.730 --> 04:32.800
vote question.

35
04:33.000 --> 04:36.740
question Id let's also copy the form

36
04:40.980 --> 04:42.210
and then paste here.

37
04:46.230 --> 04:52.910
And change the id to up vote question

38
04:53.110 --> 04:53.860
question id

39
04:58.410 --> 05:02.530
and also change the action to questions

40
05:03.570 --> 05:05.750
question id vote

41
05:14.970 --> 05:18.530
here we don't need this to delete method so let's remove it

42
05:19.650 --> 05:23.050
Instead we need to send a value to represent the vote up

43
05:26.230 --> 05:30.330
So here we call request vote

44
05:34.690 --> 05:36.420
so lets define a hidden input

45
05:45.280 --> 05:53.850
and then call it vote then the value will be one.

46
05:54.070 --> 05:55.150
Let's also change this

47
05:58.230 --> 05:58.710
to

48
06:01.450 --> 06:04.620
question votes count

49
06:09.590 --> 06:10.200
now

50
06:10.940 --> 06:14.640
let's also make chance to vote down button

51
06:14.820 --> 06:17.160
So let's firstly copy this class

52
06:28.090 --> 06:30.160
and then paste here.

53
06:33.150 --> 06:34.140
also the on click

54
06:44.990 --> 06:48.090
change the id to down vote question

55
06:59.070 --> 07:00.230
let's also copy the form

56
07:03.980 --> 07:05.290
and then paste here.

57
07:06.900 --> 07:15.270
And then change the id to down vote 
question and hear the vote will be a -1

58
07:16.840 --> 07:18.090
All right let's save all these

59
07:22.670 --> 07:26.110
and hopefully the vote buttons are working.

60
07:26.140 --> 07:27.730
Let's switch over to our browser

61
07:36.350 --> 07:37.640
let's randomly select a question

62
07:45.250 --> 07:46.150
and here

63
07:46.240 --> 07:48.800
the votes count is zero

64
07:48.840 --> 07:50.210
Let me hit the vote up

65
07:55.730 --> 08:00.100
Now the number increasing. If I hit this vote down

66
08:05.050 --> 08:07.330
now the number decreasing.

67
08:07.330 --> 08:13.920
You may be asking why the number 
increasing from zero to two or a vice versa.

68
08:14.320 --> 08:14.920
Let me show you

69
08:14.950 --> 08:15.930
in phpmyadmin let's

70
08:32.090 --> 08:34.820
see the questions.

71
08:34.930 --> 08:38.740
So here "optio amet"

72
08:38.780 --> 08:40.160
bla bla bla

73
08:44.940 --> 08:47.250
I'm sure the ID is 6

74
08:51.510 --> 08:52.530
now if I

75
08:52.720 --> 09:01.040
see here the question with id six has two votes.

76
09:01.140 --> 09:04.210
The first one is negative and another is positive

77
09:04.270 --> 09:09.300
one. So plus one plus negative one will return zero.

78
09:09.300 --> 09:11.690
Now let me see the user

79
09:12.660 --> 09:16.140
So here I log in as "Jameson Bogan"

80
09:22.700 --> 09:28.530
Jameson Bogan has ID one and here

81
09:31.240 --> 09:33.510
id one negative.

82
09:33.560 --> 09:41.010
So when I clicked the vote up it update 
the existing vote from -1 to 1.

83
09:41.010 --> 09:44.300
So one plus one will result two.

84
09:44.910 --> 09:46.600
So I hope it makes sense to you.

85
09:52.710 --> 09:54.840
Let me try another question

86
09:59.390 --> 10:00.920
If I hit this vote up button

87
10:04.920 --> 10:06.150
it will be zero

88
10:12.200 --> 10:12.460
OK

89
10:12.470 --> 10:13.150
Great

90
10:13.160 --> 10:15.680
Now our vote question controls working perfectly.
