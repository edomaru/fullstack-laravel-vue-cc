In this video we're going to take a look 
at how to protect a route in this case

1
00:06.490 --> 00:14.600
my posts route from being access by unauthenticated user. 
The mechanism probably the same thing with middleware

2
00:14.990 --> 00:18.160
when we're working on backend stuff with laravel.

3
00:18.170 --> 00:25.980
All right let's switch over to our editor and go to routes.js

4
00:26.190 --> 00:28.220
where we define our entire front end routes.

5
00:31.410 --> 00:37.000
And here let's add additional information on this

6
00:37.040 --> 00:45.350
my posts route. We can do that by adding `meta`
then in there we can specify any values

7
00:48.110 --> 00:54.260
now because I want to make this route only accessible 
when the users have successfully sign in here

8
00:54.260 --> 01:03.590
I'll say requires auth equal true don't forget

9
01:03.590 --> 01:04.400
comma here.

10
01:06.790 --> 01:10.100
So remember we can specify any values here.

11
01:10.300 --> 01:16.550
So you could say is logged in authenticated 
or something else that you prefer. Here

12
01:16.630 --> 01:19.830
I'll stick with requires auth. All right

13
01:19.840 --> 01:32.850
mow we can go to router index.js than here before 
we export the router instance we can do a global

14
01:32.940 --> 01:37.830
before guard by saying router before each

15
01:40.910 --> 01:48.860
as noted in vue router official buide that the global before 
guards are called in creation order whenever a navigation

16
01:48.860 --> 01:49.970
is triggered.

17
01:50.090 --> 01:56.450
Guards may be resolved asynchronously and the navigation is considered pending before all hooks have

18
01:56.450 --> 01:57.740
been resolved.

19
01:57.740 --> 02:06.770
So this method receives a callback which 
contains three arguments `to` `from` and `next`

20
02:11.430 --> 02:18.930
the `to` is a target router object being navigated to 
`from` is a current route being navigated away from

21
02:19.250 --> 02:24.410
and the `next` is called the function 
that must be called to resolve the hook.

22
02:24.510 --> 02:37.460
Here we can check whether a route record contains meta 
dot requiresAuth by seeing if `to` matched dot some

23
02:39.430 --> 02:41.410
then we will need to provide a callback function

24
02:43.970 --> 03:01.270
r arrow r meter requires auth. This basically means 
if a particular route record contains meta requires

25
03:01.270 --> 03:13.000
auth we can then add an and operator followed by not window auth

26
03:15.600 --> 03:16.350
signed in

27
03:21.440 --> 03:29.750
so if someone not sign in and access any route that has 
requires auth we will do something. In here we can

28
03:29.750 --> 03:38.060
utilize the next callback to kind of redirect 
or forward the request to other page.

29
03:38.150 --> 03:43.870
For example if I want to forward a requests 
to login page we can say next

30
03:45.330 --> 03:48.810
name login

31
03:48.810 --> 03:54.120
Since we haven't defined any route for login and 
we don't need that because we'll stick with server

32
03:54.120 --> 03:57.590
side login then we cannot use this standard way.

33
03:57.600 --> 04:02.820
Instead we're going to redirect to the actual 
laravel login page by using vanilla javascript like

34
04:02.820 --> 04:14.180
so window location equals window auth url

35
04:17.750 --> 04:19.030
don't forget to add

36
04:19.070 --> 04:23.110
return to ignore the next execution

37
04:23.190 --> 04:28.840
outside the if statement. So here outside the if statement

38
04:28.860 --> 04:31.630
we can call next like

39
04:31.710 --> 04:35.120
so. That means move on to the next hook.

40
04:35.820 --> 04:39.380
So make sure to always call this next callback. 

41
04:39.460 --> 04:46.410
Now since we call this window auth 
url so let's go to spa blade php

42
04:49.340 --> 04:50.440
scroll all the way down

43
04:53.500 --> 04:54.460
and here

44
04:54.540 --> 05:06.570
let's add url and we'll set it to route login. Let's save all changes

45
05:13.450 --> 05:19.700
reload the page. Here I can still access 
it because I currently logged in.

46
05:19.780 --> 05:22.060
Now let me log out from here.

47
05:25.910 --> 05:26.660
Now let visit

48
05:26.660 --> 05:30.690
my posts. Something went wrong.

49
05:31.980 --> 05:36.450
Let me go to my editor then go to web.php

50
05:39.900 --> 05:45.090
OK here I need to move this before this route.

51
05:47.790 --> 05:48.420
Save

52
05:55.110 --> 05:57.890
Great now I'll be taken to log in page.
