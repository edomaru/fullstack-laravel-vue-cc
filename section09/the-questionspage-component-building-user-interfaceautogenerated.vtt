00:01.110 --> 00:06.300
All right let's pull up questions index.blade.php

1
00:12.110 --> 00:15.170
then copy everything inside this section content

2
00:19.630 --> 00:20.860
back to the questions page

3
00:24.950 --> 00:27.920
then replace this with previous markup

4
00:32.420 --> 00:43.370
let's adjust the indentation a little bit then we need 
to replace blade related code such as this link. For

5
00:43.390 --> 00:47.060
now let's replace the links target to hash

6
00:52.760 --> 01:03.810
and then for now let's replace this code with 
a message let's say "All questions here".

7
01:03.860 --> 01:13.160
All right let's save the change back 
to the browser go to Home Page.

8
01:13.180 --> 01:21.960
Now we have card header ask Question 
button and all question here. OK

9
01:22.090 --> 01:25.120
Now let's actually display all questions in here.

10
01:25.120 --> 01:29.960
Let's switch back over to our editor. And here

11
01:30.090 --> 01:31.920
let's undo a couple of times

12
01:35.700 --> 01:36.070
OK

13
01:36.070 --> 01:37.270
Here we go.

14
01:37.270 --> 01:41.110
So here we don't need this message.

15
01:41.110 --> 01:42.370
So let's get rid of that

16
01:47.530 --> 01:55.230
then here we call forelse which basically for each 
loop in a slightly different form. Inside here we

17
01:55.240 --> 01:58.560
loop through the questions underscore excerpt.

18
01:59.200 --> 02:01.740
So before we replace this blade code

19
02:01.840 --> 02:06.830
let's see the excerpt. So let's pull open this file

20
02:13.220 --> 02:18.260
and as you already known that this file 
basically represents a single question.

21
02:18.260 --> 02:29.770
So let's copy everything inside this file. Let's navigate 
to js components. And . here let's create a brand

22
02:29.770 --> 02:30.460
new component

23
02:33.190 --> 02:33.460
here

24
02:33.460 --> 02:39.790
I'm going to call it question item dot vue or

25
02:39.880 --> 02:47.430
let me call it question excerpt dot vue

26
02:52.640 --> 02:53.940
in here

27
02:54.050 --> 03:00.260
let's add template then inside this 
template just paste the previous code

28
03:10.200 --> 03:10.640
OK

29
03:10.680 --> 03:17.150
let's start from the easiest part. Let's select question

30
03:17.320 --> 03:23.160
arrow then hit command+d to select other instances or control+d

31
03:23.320 --> 03:24.310
If you're using PC.

32
03:32.010 --> 03:37.460
after all selected let's change them to question dot

33
03:44.440 --> 03:45.020
Next

34
03:45.040 --> 03:52.880
here we have str_plural which will return plural 
or singular word based on the number that we

35
03:52.880 --> 03:54.150
specified.

36
03:54.220 --> 04:03.040
The simplest way could be replacing this with just views 
or we can keep it as it is and defined by ourself.

37
04:03.850 --> 04:05.380
So let's go to script section

38
04:12.870 --> 04:13.860
inside here

39
04:13.860 --> 04:15.240
let's add methods

40
04:20.330 --> 04:21.820
then inside this methods

41
04:22.010 --> 04:24.110
let's define the str_plural

42
04:29.580 --> 04:32.100
this method will accept two arguments.

43
04:32.100 --> 04:35.790
The first one is str or string.

44
04:36.000 --> 04:42.270
Then the second one is count or number.

45
04:42.330 --> 04:58.200
In here we simply say return str plus parentheses 
if count is greater than one we'll add s.

46
04:58.530 --> 05:00.690
Otherwise just empty string

47
05:07.180 --> 05:11.700
let's replace this dot php concatenation with plus

48
05:17.660 --> 05:27.860
then let's replace all route calling in anchor tag 
as well as in form tag with the hash for now

49
05:35.860 --> 05:36.250
all right

50
05:36.280 --> 05:44.150
The next thing that we need to do is replace this 
can blade directive with the javascript code.

51
05:44.560 --> 05:57.150
If you remember we have policies. So here we can 
utilize this modify to authorize the update. And for

52
05:57.150 --> 06:05.320
delete we can also use the modify but for 
question it's better to use delete question.

53
06:05.430 --> 06:07.680
So let's go back to question excerpt

54
06:12.790 --> 06:13.550
then here

55
06:13.600 --> 06:20.550
let's remove this can update question as well as this  endcan

56
06:27.770 --> 06:37.430
then here we can simply say the v-if authorize modify question

57
06:40.800 --> 06:42.670
let's do the same thing to this form

58
06:53.380 --> 06:59.460
and here we'll say v-if authorize delete

59
06:59.680 --> 07:02.500
question

60
07:02.500 --> 07:03.040
question.

61
07:05.800 --> 07:07.260
Next

62
07:07.400 --> 07:09.060
let's select this

63
07:09.290 --> 07:17.750
user arrow then replace with user dot.

64
07:19.240 --> 07:20.330
So question

65
07:20.380 --> 07:22.430
user url query

66
07:22.450 --> 07:23.140
user name.

67
07:26.780 --> 07:36.290
And last let's replace this excerpt method call with excerpt.

68
07:36.330 --> 07:39.450
All right let's jump to script section

69
07:42.650 --> 07:47.810
then define a props so props

70
07:47.890 --> 07:50.360
colon array

71
07:50.830 --> 07:51.430
question.

72
07:55.510 --> 08:00.580
All right now let's go back to questions page.

73
08:00.840 --> 08:01.840
Let's go to the bottom.

74
08:05.900 --> 08:06.460
In here

75
08:06.470 --> 08:07.730
let's add script

76
08:12.830 --> 08:13.220
then here

77
08:13.250 --> 08:15.890
let's import the question excerpt component that we just created.

78
08:25.360 --> 08:33.970
Inside here let's add components and in this 
components let's put in the question excerpt.

79
08:38.580 --> 08:43.880
Let's also add data method and it's going to return an object

80
08:46.950 --> 08:52.260
and inside here let's define a property that 
we're gonna use to hold all questions.

81
08:52.280 --> 08:57.920
So questions and we'll set it with empty array.

82
08:59.390 --> 09:01.160
Now we can go back to our template

83
09:06.470 --> 09:15.840
let's remove this forelse directive as well 
as include an empty. Then let's add a div

84
09:21.690 --> 09:30.000
and we'll say v-if questions length.

85
09:30.470 --> 09:35.150
Then inside here we can loop through 
the question exert like so questions

86
09:35.160 --> 09:35.610
excerpt

87
09:41.960 --> 09:42.620
v-for

88
09:45.520 --> 09:46.590
question

89
09:46.750 --> 09:48.310
in questions.

90
09:51.250 --> 10:09.320
Bind the question with question and bind the key with question id.

91
10:09.370 --> 10:17.500
Here we can add in this alert v-else. So if there's one or 
more questions we will loop through all questions.

92
10:17.650 --> 10:21.400
Otherwise we'll show this message.

93
10:21.400 --> 10:22.600
Don't forget to remove this line

94
10:27.420 --> 10:28.130
and reindent this.

95
10:31.890 --> 10:36.180
Here for the pagination we'll be doing that in upcoming lesson.

96
10:36.180 --> 10:45.730
So for now let's replace this with the comment.

97
10:45.760 --> 10:46.290
All right.

98
10:46.310 --> 10:47.060
Save all changes

99
10:49.880 --> 10:51.610
Ups I get error.

100
11:05.050 --> 11:08.530
So here interpolation inside attribute has been removed

101
11:11.900 --> 11:13.160
So I cannot do this way

102
11:18.750 --> 11:20.490
let me go to question excerpt

103
11:25.220 --> 11:35.790
so let's replace this with class equals let's say status classes

104
11:38.630 --> 11:40.040
let's jump to our script

105
11:43.100 --> 11:51.980
then let's add computed and in here let's define status classes

106
11:57.050 --> 11:59.130
and this method simply return an array

107
12:01.950 --> 12:13.800
and it's contain status class and this question status. Let's save.

108
12:17.090 --> 12:17.790
still got error

109
12:23.970 --> 12:26.600
Okay here.

110
12:26.600 --> 12:28.840
question user url in href

111
12:35.230 --> 12:39.130
so just replace this with hash

112
12:43.220 --> 12:44.000
also this one

113
12:47.580 --> 12:48.030
Save

114
12:51.690 --> 12:55.800
OK back to our browser and reload

115
12:59.410 --> 13:05.580
here we have a message because currently we're not 
holding any questions so now let's consume our API

116
13:05.700 --> 13:06.480
in this component.
