00:01.580 --> 00:07.410
In the last video we've made change our route 
behavior in the backend to load only a single page

1
00:07.770 --> 00:09.890
for any request comes in.

2
00:10.320 --> 00:14.790
Now in this video we're going to install 
vue router and then define some routes

3
00:20.860 --> 00:31.980
Okay let's install the vue router by saying 
npm install vue router capital d. Alright

4
00:32.170 --> 00:35.130
while that processing let's create some vue components

5
00:39.800 --> 00:46.490
now you could create the component inside the components directory like we did before but this component

6
00:46.610 --> 00:48.630
will represent an entire page.

7
00:48.680 --> 00:53.060
So I think it will be better to place this 
component into separate directory.

8
00:55.850 --> 00:56.710
Actually

9
00:56.720 --> 01:04.590
here we already have that directory and 
we also have question page dot vue inside.

10
01:04.610 --> 01:07.830
So let's put our new components inside here.

11
01:08.510 --> 01:09.560
Let's create a new file

12
01:12.850 --> 01:19.340
let's call it questions page dot vue.

13
01:19.990 --> 01:29.500
So questions in plural this file will be used 
to display all the questions in our application.

14
01:29.530 --> 01:30.680
Let's create another file

15
01:36.040 --> 01:41.340
this file is going to display all the questions 
and answers of the current users logged in.

16
01:41.440 --> 01:47.560
So here let's call it my posts page

17
01:47.680 --> 01:57.010
dot vue. All right in this file for now let's add 
a simple markup let's add a template tag

18
02:00.300 --> 02:01.140
inside here

19
02:01.140 --> 02:02.970
let's add a message in a heading one

20
02:11.640 --> 02:14.130
let's copy everything here.

21
02:15.190 --> 02:19.980
Go to questions page then paste it in here

22
02:23.240 --> 02:32.500
and change this to questions page. All right now 
that we have three components inside this pages

23
02:32.500 --> 02:39.140
directory. We can think of these files like 
view files in our laravel backend application.

24
02:39.340 --> 02:48.260
So in order to show them we need to provided some 
routes in our frontend. So to do that here in js folder

25
02:48.560 --> 02:49.610
let's create a new folder

26
02:52.970 --> 03:04.730
here I'm going to call it router. Then inside this
directory let's get a brand new file let's call it index

27
03:04.770 --> 03:05.300
dot js

28
03:08.070 --> 03:08.660
in here

29
03:08.710 --> 03:10.200
let's firstly import the vue

30
03:17.250 --> 03:19.550
then we also need to import the vue route

31
03:29.720 --> 03:35.990
this file is basically going to be install and instantiate 
the vue router and for the routes definition

32
03:36.250 --> 03:38.780
we'll place them in separate file.

33
03:38.780 --> 03:40.400
So here let's import that file

34
03:47.590 --> 03:53.670
this file is currently doesn't exist and will create that file shortly.

35
03:53.950 --> 03:54.850
All right

36
03:55.000 --> 03:57.890
the vue router  basically is a plug in.

37
03:57.940 --> 04:04.180
So we need to integrate to vue by saying vue use vue router.

38
04:11.790 --> 04:24.430
Next let's instantiate the vue router by saying new 
vue router. We can assign this into a variable let's

39
04:24.430 --> 04:27.160
say router

40
04:32.420 --> 04:39.680
then here we can specify at least two options 
for the vue router instance. The first one is mode

41
04:42.540 --> 04:46.290
the default mode is hash mode which is use the URL hash

42
04:49.060 --> 04:50.800
so you will have something like this

43
04:54.420 --> 04:56.310
or like this

44
04:59.890 --> 05:05.360
so having this route will not need the page reload 
when the URL changes but I think this not look

45
05:05.360 --> 05:11.880
so good. To use normal URL we can set the mode to history

46
05:14.790 --> 05:19.960
next we need to define some routes and we'll do that in the routes file.

47
05:20.250 --> 05:28.540
So here we can say routes routes 
or we can simply say just routes

48
05:32.860 --> 05:38.910
now to make this vue router actually work we need 
to  pass the vue router instance in the option of

49
05:38.910 --> 05:40.400
the vue instance.

50
05:40.410 --> 05:46.860
So here we can export the router instance 
by saying export default router

51
05:50.370 --> 05:54.720
Alright now let's create in this router directory a new file

52
05:57.450 --> 06:04.290
we'll call it routes routes dot js and we'll define the actual routes here.

53
06:08.820 --> 06:09.850
Okay here

54
06:09.870 --> 06:18.810
Firstly let's import every single component inside 
pages directory. So import questions page

55
06:21.480 --> 06:26.820
from here we are inside routes directory

56
06:26.940 --> 06:29.580
So we need to go up one level

57
06:29.580 --> 06:33.570
Then pages then questions

58
06:33.570 --> 06:33.990
page.

59
06:45.040 --> 06:51.080
let's duplicate this line 2 times then here

60
06:51.240 --> 06:58.290
let's select the component name by 
hitting the common D or control D

61
06:58.290 --> 07:06.660
Then let's replace to question page let's continue by select

62
07:07.280 --> 07:16.570
this last line and then replace with my posts page.

63
07:16.660 --> 07:19.370
All right now we have three components loaded.

64
07:19.820 --> 07:24.440
The next thing that we need to do is map every 
single component to the respective route

65
07:27.530 --> 07:29.420
we can do that in an array.

66
07:29.420 --> 07:40.090
So const routes equals array then inside this array we 
can map the route path to the component represented

67
07:40.180 --> 07:52.450
in object. So here we'll need path and this path is 
going to be root path or forward slash then we'll

68
07:52.450 --> 07:55.910
need to tell which component that will map to this route.

69
07:56.280 --> 08:02.420
Here will say component equals questions

70
08:03.730 --> 08:04.180
page.

71
08:07.390 --> 08:10.590
Now we also need to define the name for this route.

72
08:10.690 --> 08:16.060
You can think of the name here like name route 
when you're working with laravel route

73
08:16.990 --> 08:18.300
So here

74
08:18.430 --> 08:26.390
name and this route is going to be home. Okay

75
08:26.470 --> 08:31.490
so now we have a route definition to map 
the root route to the questions page.

76
08:31.660 --> 08:36.750
So whenever we visit the route route this component will be returned.

77
08:36.790 --> 08:39.130
Now let's duplicate this route definition

78
08:43.440 --> 08:49.670
add comma here here. The path is gonna be questions

79
08:50.880 --> 08:54.520
The component that will be mapped is 
gonna be the same with the root path

80
08:54.520 --> 09:00.300
Questions page. You could possibly map the root path 
to the other component if you want but in my case

81
09:00.540 --> 09:05.290
I'll have two routes which return the same component. Okay

82
09:05.310 --> 09:10.830
here we'll call this route as questions in plural

83
09:14.040 --> 09:14.770
let's duplicate

84
09:14.950 --> 09:15.570
once again

85
09:20.330 --> 09:26.020
change the path to let's say my posts

86
09:30.200 --> 09:33.950
we'll map this path to my posts

87
09:33.950 --> 09:37.910
page and we'll call it

88
09:40.570 --> 09:47.120
my posts. Let's duplicate the route definition one more time.

89
09:52.010 --> 09:55.800
The path is gonna be questions

90
09:58.240 --> 10:01.720
forward slash colon slug.

91
10:02.590 --> 10:06.130
So this is something called dynamic route matching.

92
10:06.130 --> 10:12.710
Probably it's similar with route parameter 
in a laravel so this basically similar with

93
10:15.540 --> 10:17.190
slug in level.

94
10:24.510 --> 10:24.980
Alright

95
10:25.020 --> 10:35.590
we are map the path to question page 
singular and for the name let's call it

96
10:39.030 --> 10:41.850
questions dot show.

97
10:43.010 --> 10:49.350
OK now we have our routes defined the last thing that 
we need to do here is to export the routes because

98
10:49.350 --> 10:54.810
remember we'll call this file in our router index

99
11:01.830 --> 11:05.130
export default routes

100
11:10.760 --> 11:11.850
OK

101
11:11.920 --> 11:17.890
Now to make the vue router actually work we need 
to pass in its instance in our main JavaScript file

102
11:18.280 --> 11:23.890
so let's open the app dot js in resources

103
11:23.910 --> 11:24.340
js

104
11:28.580 --> 11:30.350
in here let's

105
11:30.460 --> 11:36.200
Important the router by saying import router from

106
11:38.700 --> 11:39.300
router

107
11:42.660 --> 11:48.510
please note that we don't need to specify the index 
dot js in here and that's probably the benefit of

108
11:48.510 --> 11:49.650
following the convention.

109
11:50.040 --> 11:56.620
So just in case you name it with other name 
then you would need to specify the full name.

110
11:56.620 --> 11:57.150
All right

111
11:57.150 --> 12:01.880
here in vue configuration we can pass in the router instance.

112
12:08.320 --> 12:08.570
Now

113
12:08.590 --> 12:13.840
the last thing that we need to do is to actually show the matches component in our view.

114
12:13.840 --> 12:17.800
So let's jump into spa.blade.php

115
12:21.190 --> 12:26.690
and here we can leverage the router vue component 
that will render the match component for the given

116
12:26.690 --> 12:29.920
path.  Now let's save all changes

117
12:34.850 --> 12:43.490
I'll reopen my terminal okay here the vue router 
installed and now I'll run npm run watch

118
12:50.040 --> 12:54.270
all right head back to browser.

119
12:54.960 --> 13:02.750
Let's visit questions

120
13:02.820 --> 13:04.480
There we go

121
13:04.530 --> 13:08.640
We get questions page show up if we go to Home page

122
13:11.430 --> 13:12.850
we'll get the same thing.

123
13:12.960 --> 13:19.900
Now let's ciair my posts.

124
13:19.930 --> 13:23.310
Sure enough we'll get the current users post page.

125
13:23.530 --> 13:24.730
Now if we go to

126
13:28.360 --> 13:30.760
questions test

127
13:34.600 --> 13:36.440
here we will get nothing.

128
13:36.440 --> 13:38.170
Let me open browser console.

129
13:41.400 --> 13:42.350
Here

130
13:42.610 --> 13:43.820
I get error.

131
13:44.050 --> 13:49.220
Probably we need to make some tweak in our question 
page component and we'll fix that later on.

132
13:50.790 --> 13:54.660
But overall we have our routes displaying 
the components properly.
