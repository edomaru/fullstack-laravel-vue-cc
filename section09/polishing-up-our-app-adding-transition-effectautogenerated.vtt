In this lesson we're going to add transition effect to 
our application to make switching between the pages

1
00:08.460 --> 00:10.110
looks smoother.

2
00:10.200 --> 00:16.590
We'll also add AJAX spinner when API being hit to indicate 
that the request being processed and waiting

3
00:16.590 --> 00:18.380
for the response.

4
00:18.390 --> 00:20.580
All right let's head over to our terminal

5
00:23.280 --> 00:25.140
and here let me create a new branch

6
00:31.860 --> 00:32.210
OK

7
00:32.450 --> 00:44.330
let's run Laravel mix by saying npm run watch.

8
00:44.840 --> 00:47.610
All right to add transition effect in Vue

9
00:47.610 --> 00:53.370
actually it's very easy. Let's open spa.blade.php

10
00:58.370 --> 01:02.710
and here let's wrap this router view with

11
01:05.850 --> 01:06.570
transition

12
01:15.090 --> 01:28.020
let's specify name to fed. For transitioning between 
components will also need to specify mode and it's

13
01:28.020 --> 01:30.430
gonna be out in

14
01:30.630 --> 01:32.220
which means current element

15
01:32.220 --> 01:39.380
transition out first then when complete 
the new element transitions in.

16
01:39.600 --> 01:42.290
Now let's define our transition styles.

17
01:42.360 --> 01:46.170
Let's open app.scss

18
01:53.100 --> 01:53.860
And here

19
01:53.890 --> 01:56.810
let's define fade

20
01:57.190 --> 01:58.990
enter active

21
02:03.540 --> 02:07.050
fade leave active

22
02:10.690 --> 02:16.810
so the fade prefix should be match with the 
name that we specified in the transition name

23
02:21.680 --> 02:21.970
here

24
02:22.000 --> 02:26.370
let's add css transition effect by saying transition

25
02:29.240 --> 02:29.930
opacity

26
02:32.970 --> 02:35.120
in 3 second linear

27
02:38.990 --> 02:40.840
let's also define fade

28
02:41.750 --> 02:42.230
enter

29
02:45.500 --> 02:49.530
fade leave to

30
02:50.000 --> 02:53.110
and in here let's set the opacity to zero.

31
02:58.010 --> 02:58.500
All right

32
02:58.730 --> 02:59.670
let's save all changes

33
03:03.800 --> 03:04.840
and let's see how that look

34
03:08.890 --> 03:09.620
reload the page

35
03:14.030 --> 03:16.700
now if we switch to my post page

36
03:20.230 --> 03:21.430
back to questions.

37
03:23.300 --> 03:26.870
As you can see now switching between the pages looks smoother

38
03:34.630 --> 03:36.400
Alright in the next video

39
03:36.430 --> 03:38.560
we'll see how the show the AJAX spinner.
