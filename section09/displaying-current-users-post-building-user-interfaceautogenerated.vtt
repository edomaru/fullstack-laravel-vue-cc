In this lesson we're going to consume the current user's 
post API endpoint and display the response in

1
00:07.560 --> 00:07.870
this

2
00:07.860 --> 00:09.590
My posts page.

3
00:09.800 --> 00:15.650
All right let's go ahead and open up our terminal then here

4
00:15.730 --> 00:17.050
I'm going to create a new branch

5
00:24.450 --> 00:34.060
now let's fire up the laravel mix.

6
00:34.340 --> 00:34.910
All right

7
00:34.910 --> 00:41.520
first thing first let's build user interface for my posts page here

8
00:41.600 --> 00:44.390
let's navigate to get bootstrap dot com

9
00:47.690 --> 00:49.300
go to documentation

10
00:52.840 --> 00:54.070
then components

11
00:57.820 --> 01:01.810
card and let's find navigation

12
01:05.730 --> 01:14.150
and here we'll add something like this in our application.
So let's copy this markup back to our editor

13
01:15.580 --> 01:20.460
then open my post page dot vue

14
01:25.120 --> 01:29.110
let's remove this and add container

15
01:31.890 --> 01:33.240
inside this container

16
01:33.280 --> 01:33.900
let's add a row

17
01:36.990 --> 01:43.440
and inside this row let's add col-md-12 to have full with

18
01:46.610 --> 01:48.560
then inside here just paste the markup

19
01:53.630 --> 01:54.720
let's indent a little bit

20
02:04.420 --> 02:14.620
so here for the first nav item let's change to all, 
for the second one it is gonna be questions

21
02:20.720 --> 02:25.380
remove these and duplicate

22
02:28.890 --> 02:37.370
and here it's going to be answers.

23
02:37.450 --> 02:42.280
All right let's save this changes and let's see how that look.

24
02:49.420 --> 02:49.820
All right

25
02:52.720 --> 03:02.630
Now let's change the content here. Back 
to get bootstrap dot com, go to list group

26
03:05.960 --> 03:10.210
on the right side let's hit this flush menu.

27
03:13.570 --> 03:16.200
So here we'll bring this UI to display

28
03:16.200 --> 03:24.390
our questions and answers. So let's 
copy this markup back to our editor.

29
03:29.470 --> 03:33.030
Here in card body let's select everything

30
03:36.320 --> 03:37.190
then paste the little group

31
03:47.690 --> 03:48.120
here

32
03:48.140 --> 03:51.380
let's keep one list group item and remove the rest.

33
03:57.830 --> 04:02.130
Let's remove the text and here

34
04:02.170 --> 04:04.180
let's split this into three parts.

35
04:06.710 --> 04:07.880
So let's add another row

36
04:11.270 --> 04:12.290
inside this row

37
04:12.290 --> 04:14.360
let's add bootstrap col class

38
04:18.140 --> 04:19.240
inside this column

39
04:19.240 --> 04:24.610
let's add two things will add a span and it's going to has class

40
04:24.610 --> 04:27.760
let's say posts badge

41
04:30.940 --> 04:36.220
and another class to indicate that the 
question is accepted so accepted.

42
04:41.180 --> 04:45.670
This span basically indicate an item is a question or answer.

43
04:45.750 --> 04:56.350
It it's a question is going to be Q, if it's answer is 
gonna be A. Let's duplicate this span. Here let's add

44
04:56.370 --> 04:57.520
a space from the left

45
04:57.530 --> 05:08.990
span by adding bootstrap margin left class maybe 
ml four. Then I'll replace this with votes count

46
05:12.430 --> 05:17.570
then I'm gonna change the text to let's say 10.

47
05:18.610 --> 05:18.880
All right

48
05:19.810 --> 05:25.870
Let's add another column this column 
will be hold the question title.

49
05:25.870 --> 05:31.510
So here I'm gonna add col-md-9 in here

50
05:31.690 --> 05:32.770
let me add a dummy text

51
05:39.890 --> 05:41.700
let's add another column here

52
05:41.720 --> 05:43.730
I'm going to use bootstrap col class

53
05:46.770 --> 05:56.910
and I want to make the text inside on the 
right so text right. Here we'll show a date

54
06:05.740 --> 06:12.890
OK let me select these and duplicate two times

55
06:16.660 --> 06:27.420
and I'll make change a bit

56
06:27.490 --> 06:30.370
Now if we save this and see in our browser

57
06:36.270 --> 06:41.200
OK here we have three items displayed like this.

58
06:41.230 --> 06:45.340
Now let's style this back to our editor.

59
06:46.380 --> 06:52.510
And here instead of defining this css in global 
app.scss file here I'm going to define in this

60
06:52.510 --> 06:53.050
component

61
06:59.360 --> 07:12.930
so here let's add style let's change the lang to scss 
and let's also add scoped to make sure that our

62
07:12.930 --> 07:15.300
style only get applied in this component.

63
07:21.670 --> 07:25.120
Firstly let's define a sass variable here

64
07:25.120 --> 07:42.940
I'm gonna call color green and I'll set it to grba  ninety 
five one hundred eighty seven one hundred twenty

65
07:42.940 --> 07:43.420
six

66
07:48.370 --> 07:48.820
okay

67
07:48.820 --> 07:51.160
now let's define the votes count css rule

68
07:55.780 --> 07:56.080
here

69
07:56.140 --> 07:57.040
let's set the border

70
08:03.760 --> 08:06.350
then let's custom the display to inline block

71
08:13.150 --> 08:14.230
by doing this way

72
08:14.230 --> 08:21.610
the span will act like normal span which is inline 
but it's has the ability to have with padding and

73
08:21.610 --> 08:22.420
so on.

74
08:24.040 --> 08:25.030
Let's set the min with

75
08:27.680 --> 08:33.490
to let's say 40 pixels.

76
08:33.740 --> 08:36.980
Then let's set the text alignment to center

77
08:42.950 --> 08:43.360
Alright

78
08:43.640 --> 08:45.710
let's also define accepted css rule

79
08:50.580 --> 08:50.950
and here

80
08:50.960 --> 08:54.340
when accepted we'll set the background color to a color green.

81
08:59.880 --> 09:02.400
Then we'll change the border color to color green

82
09:10.800 --> 09:12.870
and we'll change the text color to a white.

83
09:22.510 --> 09:24.520
Let's define another css rule

84
09:24.540 --> 09:25.320
in this case

85
09:27.960 --> 09:28.680
post badge.

86
09:33.200 --> 09:35.510
Actually let me duplicate these

87
09:39.290 --> 09:41.510
change the name to post badge

88
09:45.640 --> 09:45.850
here

89
09:45.850 --> 09:53.230
let's change this to with and it's gonna be twenty five pixels

90
09:59.350 --> 10:02.560
then to make a circle let's add border radius

91
10:05.960 --> 10:08.060
and set it to one hundred percent.

92
10:15.550 --> 10:22.790
Let's remove the background and change the color to color green

93
10:26.750 --> 10:30.300
Let's save and let's see how that look

94
10:37.000 --> 10:37.520
All right

95
10:37.700 --> 10:40.230
I think this much better.

96
10:40.550 --> 10:46.730
So now that we have user interface to display current 
user's posts. Let's now consume or backend API

97
10:47.040 --> 10:50.180
and display the result in this component to make it dynamic.
