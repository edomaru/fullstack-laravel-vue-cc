00:02.460 --> 00:08.910
Now the show AJAX loader or AJAX spinner in 
our page, we're going to use font awesome.

1
00:08.910 --> 00:12.120
So let's navigate to font awesome dot com

2
00:15.790 --> 00:16.220
Here

3
00:16.240 --> 00:18.250
let's find spinner

4
00:24.600 --> 00:30.940
so here we're going to use this font and later we'll 
use special class to give rotate effect to the font.

5
00:31.790 --> 00:32.550
Here

6
00:32.580 --> 00:38.900
you can also use other class such as spinner third, circle notch

7
00:45.240 --> 00:45.960
or other class

8
00:50.540 --> 00:57.780
but I'll stick with this spinner. Actually bootstrap also 
provides spinner which does the similar thing.

9
01:06.130 --> 01:08.050
Here you'll find two types of spinner

10
01:12.620 --> 01:16.520
border spinner and growing spinner

11
01:20.470 --> 01:26.990
and you can also control the class such 
as primary secondary and so on.

12
01:27.200 --> 01:33.230
So feel free to choose font awesome or bootstrap 
spinner because they do the same thing.

13
01:33.230 --> 01:36.510
But here I'll stick with font awesome.

14
01:36.500 --> 01:41.120
All right let's go back to our editor. Then here

15
01:41.120 --> 01:42.370
Let's pull open

16
01:42.710 --> 01:43.220
font

17
01:43.220 --> 01:44.500
awesome

18
01:44.540 --> 01:45.140
dot js.

19
01:54.230 --> 01:58.120
Here let's add fa spinner

20
02:03.850 --> 02:07.510
and let's add our font to the font awesome library.

21
02:11.500 --> 02:13.390
Once the font registered now let's

22
02:13.390 --> 02:16.360
open up questions dot vue

23
02:20.960 --> 02:24.320
and right after the card

24
02:24.320 --> 02:28.170
body, let's add another div

25
02:34.700 --> 02:47.760
then we'll specify style attribute. In there we'll set 
the color to ddd and adjust the text alignment

26
02:50.390 --> 02:51.620
to center.

27
02:57.250 --> 02:58.360
Inside here

28
02:58.360 --> 03:03.910
let's call our spinner fa fa spinner.

29
03:08.490 --> 03:17.340
Then as I said to give rotate effect we'll add fa
spin. We will also need to control the font size.

30
03:17.460 --> 03:28.700
Here I'll make the font size maybe three times 
bigger from the standard fa three times. OK

31
03:28.800 --> 03:29.940
let's save all these changes

32
03:34.500 --> 03:35.510
and let's see how that look.

33
03:43.070 --> 03:43.630
All right

34
03:43.630 --> 03:46.180
Here we have our spinners show up.

35
03:46.240 --> 03:51.790
Obviously this spinner should be disappear once 
the request finished and we get the response back.

36
03:52.420 --> 03:54.810
So to do that let's go back to our editor.

37
03:58.150 --> 04:00.850
And here let's cut these lines

38
04:04.270 --> 04:07.970
and instead we'll add spinner component which will create shortly.

39
04:13.110 --> 04:13.690
OK

40
04:13.740 --> 04:24.710
let's go to js components, create new 
file and save it as spinner dot vue,

41
04:29.490 --> 04:33.410
add template and paste the markup.

42
04:39.950 --> 04:40.700
Here

43
04:40.760 --> 04:47.310
let's cut these styles and instead let's add

44
04:47.780 --> 04:50.040
class spinner

45
04:53.730 --> 04:54.660
than here

46
04:54.760 --> 04:59.040
outside template let's add style

47
05:03.220 --> 05:07.180
we don't need this lang attribute just add scoped.

48
05:10.510 --> 05:16.470
Here let's define the spinner and paste the styles here

49
05:21.810 --> 05:22.640
All right

50
05:22.960 --> 05:27.980
now let's register this component. Since this 
component could be used across pages

51
05:28.260 --> 05:33.870
so we're gonna register it globally. So let's open app dot js

52
05:39.940 --> 05:40.400
here

53
05:40.420 --> 05:52.440
firstly let's import the spinner component import 
spinner from components spinner dot vue.

54
06:00.280 --> 06:09.250
Then we can register globally using vue component 
like this. Actually we no longer need this question

55
06:09.250 --> 06:14.050
page, so let's remove this and instead will register globally

56
06:14.050 --> 06:15.070
the spinner component

57
06:22.210 --> 06:24.920
OK

58
06:25.390 --> 06:26.280
let's save and

59
06:28.970 --> 06:30.230
let's see.

60
06:36.030 --> 06:37.960
OK it's still in there.

61
06:37.980 --> 06:39.090
Let's go back to our editor,

62
06:42.100 --> 06:43.450
back to questions component,

63
06:47.150 --> 06:51.990
and here let's control this spinner to only 
appear if the request is processing

64
06:55.380 --> 07:02.600
so v-if request is processing

65
07:05.990 --> 07:09.920
or we can simply say v-if loading

66
07:13.490 --> 07:20.440
then here we can change this v if to

67
07:20.470 --> 07:23.100
v else if. Alright

68
07:23.100 --> 07:24.450
let's go to our script

69
07:27.390 --> 07:28.110
and define

70
07:31.300 --> 07:42.460
loading property and we'll set it to false so by 
default will control the spinner to disappear.

71
07:42.520 --> 07:45.630
Now we'll show the spinner before request being processed.

72
07:46.450 --> 07:48.520
So let's go to methods

73
07:51.530 --> 07:54.290
here in fetch question

74
07:54.800 --> 07:57.980
let's show the spinner by changing the loading state to true

75
08:03.700 --> 08:05.550
and then here in then method

76
08:09.000 --> 08:11.790
we need to change the loading to false to hide the spinner.

77
08:15.000 --> 08:19.500
Now since we are in a local computer 
processing request is much faster.

78
08:20.070 --> 08:27.280
So probably we couldn't see the spinner. So to simulate 
a bit long request which could happen in production,

79
08:27.330 --> 08:32.190
let's open up API questions

80
08:32.190 --> 08:32.850
controller

81
08:36.280 --> 08:37.410
in here

82
08:37.960 --> 08:48.730
let's add php sleep function to delay the execution.
In this case I delay for two seconds. All right

83
08:49.020 --> 08:50.050
let's save all changes

84
08:54.490 --> 08:55.420
and let's see how that look.

85
08:58.300 --> 09:07.170
Reload the page. Here we have our spinner appear then 
it's disappear and we'll have all questions displayed

86
09:07.670 --> 09:10.740
awesome. Back to our editor

87
09:14.410 --> 09:23.170
and here you can remove this sleep function or you 
can keep it as it was an add if statement and make sure

88
09:23.170 --> 09:26.890
that this function only get executed in development only

89
09:31.630 --> 09:35.190
so we don't need to worry in our production.

90
09:35.260 --> 09:41.550
Now let me save this and let me see if still working just fine.

91
09:42.880 --> 09:49.560
Reload OK it's still working just fine.

92
09:49.780 --> 10:00.440
Now you can try to implement the spinner on other 
pages such as Question details, my posts and so on.
