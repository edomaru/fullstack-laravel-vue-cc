All right

1
00:03.190 --> 00:07.710
Let's go back to our editor go to questions

2
00:07.710 --> 00:11.830
page jump to script section

3
00:17.350 --> 00:19.110
and here let's add mounted hook.

4
00:27.010 --> 00:27.620
in here

5
00:27.630 --> 00:28.960
let's call another method

6
00:29.490 --> 00:33.510
let's say Fetch questions

7
00:36.980 --> 00:39.350
now let's add methods

8
00:43.210 --> 00:52.470
and define the fetch questions method. Here we 
can consume our questions API endpoint like so.

9
00:52.590 --> 00:56.190
axios get questions

10
00:58.640 --> 00:59.120
then

11
01:07.510 --> 01:07.730
data

12
01:11.510 --> 01:16.410
in here we simply assign the API response to questions.

13
01:16.410 --> 01:21.820
this questions equals data data.

14
01:22.800 --> 01:24.410
Let's save.

15
01:25.090 --> 01:26.430
Back to our browser

16
01:30.540 --> 01:31.480
reload the page

17
01:34.080 --> 01:48.590
something went wrong. Let me open my browser console.

18
01:48.850 --> 01:49.810
I made typo here

19
01:53.480 --> 01:54.870
authirize

20
01:54.890 --> 01:56.510
So let me go back to my editor

21
01:59.150 --> 02:00.230
here in question excerpt

22
02:04.550 --> 02:06.850
so here it should be

23
02:07.030 --> 02:10.310
authorize save.

24
02:15.100 --> 02:24.610
Reload. All right

25
02:24.780 --> 02:27.020
now we have all questions displayed in this page

26
02:27.570 --> 02:27.990
Awesome.
