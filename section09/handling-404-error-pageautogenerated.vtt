00:01.780 --> 00:05.260
Now before we end this lesson let's add one more thing.

1
00:05.410 --> 00:12.840
Ideally when visitors visit non existing route 
in our page they will get 404 error page right?

2
00:12.890 --> 00:16.360
But currently if we try to visit non existing route

3
00:20.180 --> 00:22.000
we will get a blank here.

4
00:22.050 --> 00:29.550
So let's create a new component that represents not 
front page error and then we'll map it to our route

5
00:29.550 --> 00:32.480
Let's go back to our editor. Here

6
00:32.550 --> 00:36.180
let's switch back to routes.js

7
00:41.210 --> 00:42.440
let's duplicate this line

8
00:46.130 --> 00:53.110
and change this to let's say not found page. This

9
00:53.220 --> 00:56.970
component currently doesn't exist and we'll create that shortly.

10
00:57.230 --> 01:00.390
For now let's map this component to our route.

11
01:00.530 --> 01:02.770
But how can we do that.

12
01:02.780 --> 01:04.760
Do you have an idea?

13
01:04.760 --> 01:07.760
Well to do that we need to define a brand new route

14
01:17.750 --> 01:19.010
now for the path

15
01:19.010 --> 01:25.410
we can just say asterisk that means anything.

16
01:25.640 --> 01:28.340
Then we can specify the component

17
01:31.090 --> 01:33.770
and set it to not found

18
01:33.820 --> 01:41.550
page. Also note that this route record should 
be defined at the end of our route definition.

19
01:41.560 --> 01:47.380
If you define that as the first then any routes that you 
would access will always show the page not found

20
01:47.920 --> 01:52.900
because the vue router will scan the route path 
sequentially from the beginning to the end of the

21
01:52.900 --> 01:54.010
array.

22
01:54.010 --> 01:57.500
If one route record matches then other routes will be ignored.

23
01:58.450 --> 01:59.050
All right

24
01:59.200 --> 02:07.130
Now let's go to js pages and here let's create a brand new file.

25
02:08.120 --> 02:11.380
Let's call it not found

26
02:11.390 --> 02:12.660
page dot vue

27
02:16.290 --> 02:17.400
let's add a template tag

28
02:20.330 --> 02:26.460
and for now let's add a message page not found

29
02:30.960 --> 02:32.080
let's save all changes.

30
02:37.130 --> 02:43.480
Back to the browser reload.

31
02:43.500 --> 02:44.360
There we go

32
02:44.370 --> 02:46.850
we'll have page not found message.

33
02:47.050 --> 02:50.640
If we visit the existing route

34
02:50.760 --> 02:53.050
We have no issue.

35
02:53.080 --> 02:53.870
All right

36
02:53.870 --> 03:00.510
The next thing that we need to do is 
to make this error page a bit fancy.

37
03:00.510 --> 03:12.060
So let's navigate to getbootstrap dot com 
go to documentation and find jumbotron.

38
03:19.210 --> 03:23.370
let's just simply copy this markup back to our editor

39
03:26.600 --> 03:28.970
let's replace this with bootstrap Jumbotron

40
03:40.870 --> 03:49.870
let's change the heading to Page Not Found.

41
03:49.880 --> 03:52.780
Also let's change the paragraph to something more meaningful.

42
03:57.410 --> 04:06.910
Let's say Sorry the page you are looking for is not found.

43
04:10.810 --> 04:15.050
Let's also provide a way to go back to the homepage.

44
04:15.220 --> 04:16.990
Just get rid of these

45
04:19.840 --> 04:27.900
and add router link to name

46
04:27.910 --> 04:28.540
home

47
04:34.010 --> 04:41.990
the class is going to be btn btn primary btn lg.

48
04:45.310 --> 04:49.690
And the bottom's text is going to be back to homepage.

49
04:53.640 --> 04:54.390
Save this

50
04:57.140 --> 04:57.930
and let's have a look

51
05:05.170 --> 05:07.690
maybe I'll need  to put this in container

52
05:24.030 --> 05:24.480
reload

53
05:27.600 --> 05:30.430
OK. Let

54
05:30.480 --> 05:33.540
Me and text center

55
05:37.750 --> 05:47.310
reload again. Great I think now it is look better. And 
that's it for this lesson we've learned how to install

56
05:47.310 --> 05:50.080
and configure vue router in our application.

57
05:50.070 --> 05:54.180
We've defined some page components 
and map them to particular routes.

58
05:54.330 --> 05:59.070
We've seen how to protect a particular 
route using vue router navigation guard.

59
05:59.250 --> 06:05.180
And we've also seen how to create page 
not found error for our client routes

60
06:05.350 --> 06:11.310
In the next lesson we are gonna start consuming our 
backend API to display all the questions in our single

61
06:11.310 --> 06:13.650
page application. So see you there.
