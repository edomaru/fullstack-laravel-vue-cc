In the last video we've seen how to create AJAX spinner 
and add that in questions component. So to add

1
00:09.890 --> 00:11.400
AJAX spinner in our code

2
00:11.530 --> 00:19.510
we need to call the spinner component in our template 
and control the visibility by making use the v-if

3
00:19.510 --> 00:20.720
directive.

4
00:20.800 --> 00:30.480
Then we need to define this loading in data method 
and set it to false to make the spinner invisible

5
00:30.490 --> 00:31.000
by default.

6
00:35.350 --> 00:42.070
Then before we send the request we set the loading 
to true to make the spinner visible and we can

7
00:42.070 --> 00:43.280
set it back to false

8
00:43.390 --> 00:45.300
when we get the response.

9
00:45.460 --> 00:50.500
So basically you can add the spinner in other 
pages by following the similar steps.

10
00:50.500 --> 00:55.450
But imagine you have a lot of pages and you 
want to add the AJAX spinner on them.

11
00:55.690 --> 00:58.290
Of course following all those steps is tedious

12
00:58.330 --> 00:58.570
right?

13
00:59.920 --> 01:05.710
So in this video I'm gonna show you how to reduce 
those steps, so that we can add the AJAX spinner on

14
01:05.710 --> 01:08.070
the page more easy.

15
01:08.310 --> 01:19.110
To do that let's switch back over to our browser 
and here let's find axios axios. Hit this

16
01:19.110 --> 01:19.500
link

17
01:24.130 --> 01:27.070
then find interceptor

18
01:30.010 --> 01:30.520
OK

19
01:30.520 --> 01:31.270
Here it is.

20
01:36.030 --> 01:41.920
So here you can intercept requests or responses 
before they are handled by `then` or `catch`.

21
01:45.090 --> 01:54.020
So to add a request interceptor we can use this code 
and to add a response interceptor we can use this

22
01:54.020 --> 01:55.200
code.

23
01:55.290 --> 01:57.500
So here let's just copy these lines

24
02:00.860 --> 02:04.670
Back to our editor

25
02:04.870 --> 02:07.460
and now you might be thinking where we're gonna put the code.

26
02:08.780 --> 02:15.890
Well, we can put the code in app.js file which 
is our view js entry file. So let's often that file

27
02:19.980 --> 02:21.290
and in this file

28
02:21.410 --> 02:23.900
let's go to vue instantiation.

29
02:30.000 --> 02:33.930
So in here let's utilise the created hook,

30
02:40.980 --> 02:42.930
then inside here just paste the code.

31
02:49.470 --> 02:52.710
Here in axios interceptors request

32
02:55.420 --> 02:56.540
let's console log the message,

33
03:05.550 --> 03:06.300
copy this,

34
03:09.580 --> 03:18.110
then in axios interceptors requests just 
paste the code and change to response

35
03:18.310 --> 03:25.300
intercepted. Now if we save this, back to our browser

36
03:30.150 --> 03:37.230
open the browser console and reload.

37
03:37.300 --> 03:41.560
Here we have a request intercepted 
and then response intercepted.

38
03:42.790 --> 03:44.800
OK, now let's go back to our editor

39
03:49.270 --> 03:52.480
and here let's define data property.

40
03:55.680 --> 04:03.510
Here in vue instance we can find the data 
as property not method. And inside here

41
04:03.550 --> 04:07.450
let's define loading and we'll set it to false.

42
04:10.380 --> 04:11.550
Now here in created hook

43
04:15.860 --> 04:16.160
here

44
04:16.160 --> 04:18.650
let's change the loading to true

45
04:21.640 --> 04:25.060
and then when error occurred we can set loading back the false.

46
04:31.000 --> 04:36.220
Then in here we can set leading to falls whether succeed or failed.

47
04:39.610 --> 04:43.620
Now let's which to questions component

48
04:43.790 --> 04:45.730
and here let's remove this

49
04:47.970 --> 04:48.720
also this one

50
04:56.120 --> 04:56.820
remove this

51
05:03.950 --> 05:15.300
then in template we can chance this to root dot loading. 
So in every child component we can access the

52
05:15.300 --> 05:22.600
data of the root component using root variable. As a 
note this root the variable is fine for small contained

53
05:22.600 --> 05:30.650
instances, for anything larger you should use something 
called state management like vuex. Now let's save all

54
05:30.660 --> 05:31.320
changes

55
05:36.880 --> 05:40.900
back to our browser and reload.

56
05:43.910 --> 05:48.860
whoops I get error cannot set property loading of underlined.

57
05:59.310 --> 06:00.950
Let me see in app.js

58
06:06.870 --> 06:12.150
Here let's change all these functions to arrow function

59
06:24.230 --> 06:34.550
let me save this, back to the browser and reload. 
Okay as you can see the spinner still working and

60
06:37.760 --> 06:40.600
in console we don't have any error awesome.

61
06:45.000 --> 06:57.000
Now let me show you how easily add ajax spinner on other 
page. Back to editor and here let me open my posts

62
06:57.150 --> 06:58.410
page dot view.

63
07:09.300 --> 07:10.060
Here let me add

64
07:10.160 --> 07:10.680
spinner

65
07:15.690 --> 07:17.700
and then change this to

66
07:18.060 --> 07:18.640
v else

67
07:18.660 --> 07:23.420
if.  Let me go to questions

68
07:23.420 --> 07:30.690
controller, copy this and then open my posts

69
07:31.160 --> 07:31.850
controller

70
07:35.710 --> 07:37.860
and here just paste the code.

71
07:41.250 --> 07:42.390
Let me save all changes,

72
07:45.920 --> 07:46.840
back to the browser,

73
07:49.370 --> 07:49.880
reload.

74
07:53.930 --> 07:55.070
I'll switch to my posts

75
07:58.610 --> 08:01.380
here I have ajax spinner on this page.

76
08:01.390 --> 08:06.900
So now to add ajax spinner on the page

77
08:07.190 --> 08:17.750
we only need to add this spinner component and 
before I end this video let me go to spinner. And here

78
08:17.840 --> 08:21.080
It's better to use `i` tag instead of `div`

79
08:25.770 --> 08:26.370
let's save

80
08:29.610 --> 08:30.060
reload.

81
08:32.180 --> 08:32.850
Okay great.
