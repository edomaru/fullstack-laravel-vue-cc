In order to implement a single page application we need 
to change the routing mechanism in our application

1
00:08.020 --> 00:10.450
which usually handled in the server

2
00:10.480 --> 00:14.780
now it'll handled by the client completely. In our server we

3
00:14.810 --> 00:17.980
should only provide a single page for any request.

4
00:17.980 --> 00:20.950
Then in the client we'll need to define the routes.

5
00:21.040 --> 00:24.460
We can do that by mapping a URI path with a certain component.

6
00:25.150 --> 00:31.960
So in this video we're gonna change the Laravel web route 
behaviour in our application to always load only a single

7
00:31.960 --> 00:34.810
page for any request comes in.

8
00:34.810 --> 00:39.760
So let's go ahead and open up our terminal and here

9
00:39.800 --> 00:40.930
let's create new branch.

10
00:48.960 --> 00:49.680
All right

11
00:50.010 --> 00:53.220
let's pull open web dot php

12
00:56.200 --> 01:00.420
at the very top let's define a new route

13
01:10.850 --> 01:16.650
so this way will make any web route that 
we make to always return spa view.

14
01:16.730 --> 01:22.310
Here we constrained the format of our route 
parameter using the `where` method.

15
01:22.310 --> 01:28.640
We passed the route parameter in the first argument and 
regular expression in the second argument contained

16
01:28.640 --> 01:34.280
period an asterisk meaning zero or more of any character.

17
01:34.280 --> 01:37.200
Now we don't have the spa view just yet.

18
01:37.580 --> 01:46.710
So let's create that one.

19
01:46.880 --> 01:51.640
Actually we have welcome blade php which currently is not used.

20
01:51.770 --> 01:53.540
So let's simply rename this file

21
01:56.450 --> 02:02.260
to spa

22
02:02.390 --> 02:06.500
Now if I save this change then visit the page

23
02:10.260 --> 02:17.030
here I'll get the default laravel welcome page if we tried to enter questions.

24
02:17.900 --> 02:20.990
We still get the same page even if we try something else

25
02:26.350 --> 02:28.480
we'll still get the same page.

26
02:28.540 --> 02:31.610
All right back to our editor.

27
02:32.380 --> 02:38.380
And now instead of showing the default laravel welcome 
page let's show the proper page and in order to

28
02:38.380 --> 02:43.550
do that let's pull open app blade php

29
02:47.440 --> 02:59.190
let's copy everything in here. Open spa blade php
select everything and paste the code that we grabbed

30
02:59.250 --> 03:00.560
from our layout

31
03:04.490 --> 03:10.070
let's get rid of this yield and add a message for a while

32
03:19.010 --> 03:20.510
now refresh the page

33
03:23.400 --> 03:28.240
now our application's layout back but we 
only have a message show up here.

34
03:28.440 --> 03:28.780
All right

35
03:28.860 --> 03:33.270
I think that's all we need in our backend 
server. Now let's working on the frontend.
