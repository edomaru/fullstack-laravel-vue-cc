In the previous section you've learned about 
RESTful API development with Laravel.

1
00:06.760 --> 00:13.690
So now you have REST server and you can consume 
your APIs for internal or external use. Internal

2
00:13.690 --> 00:20.590
use means both API and user interface are in one 
place or one application as we've done so far.

3
00:21.340 --> 00:26.830
External use means both API and user 
interface placed in separate application.

4
00:27.040 --> 00:33.160
So you have one application as REST API server 
and you could have mobile app or a javascript app

5
00:33.160 --> 00:40.580
that will consume your APIs. In this section we're 
gonna build single page application or SPA and

6
00:40.580 --> 00:47.060
consume our APIs that we have build internally because 
I think this way is very easy and we don't need

7
00:47.060 --> 00:51.140
to do a lot of stuffs. Now before moving forward

8
00:51.620 --> 00:57.500
let's update our npm packages because as you might 
seen when you're pushing your changes to github

9
00:57.950 --> 01:04.970
it show you vulnerabilities warning. So if you're unsure 
about your NPM packages you can go to your terminal

10
01:07.070 --> 01:09.150
and type npm audit.

11
01:15.090 --> 01:16.210
If you get something like these

12
01:19.650 --> 01:22.550
then you need to fix your NPM packages.

13
01:22.710 --> 01:26.070
So here you can see the package name that you need to fix

14
01:26.280 --> 01:29.040
dependency information and so on

15
01:34.430 --> 01:48.410
here in the bottom I have 384 hight severity vulnerabilities. 
And here NPM also suggest to run npm audit fix. This

16
01:48.410 --> 01:54.770
command will automatically install compatible 
updates to vulnerable dependencies.

17
01:54.770 --> 01:55.340
All right

18
01:55.340 --> 02:06.410
before we do that let's create a new branch to isolate 
new changes that will make git checkout -b and

19
02:06.410 --> 02:07.280
the brand name

20
02:07.280 --> 02:17.930
let's say audit npm packages or you can give it any name you like.

21
02:17.940 --> 02:20.290
Now let's run that npm

22
02:20.460 --> 02:21.990
audit fix

23
02:26.260 --> 02:26.660
once that

24
02:26.660 --> 02:29.500
done we can execute the npm audit again

25
02:35.950 --> 02:40.030
and now I get found 0 vulnerabilities.

26
02:40.030 --> 02:48.340
Okay we fixed our NPM packages from security 
vulnerabilities by executing NPM audit fixed.

27
02:48.340 --> 02:55.180
Now I also want to make sure I don't have outdated 
packages. Here I can say NPM outdated

28
03:00.190 --> 03:07.780
here I have some outdated packages in a second column 
we can see the current version next column we

29
03:07.780 --> 03:14.080
can see the wanted version which means the maximum version of the package that satisfies the semver

30
03:14.410 --> 03:20.920
or a semantic version in range specified in packages
dot json. While the last one shows us the latest

31
03:20.920 --> 03:26.590
version or the version of the package 
tagged as latest in the registry.

32
03:26.590 --> 03:32.930
Here we can execute npm update to get the 
latest non breaking changes for all packages.

33
03:33.070 --> 03:41.530
If you want to update the next major version 
you can execute npm install package name

34
03:45.150 --> 03:48.180
at and specify the version.

35
03:48.450 --> 03:54.690
But be careful because it could have breaking changes 
and you will need to update your application to

36
03:54.690 --> 03:59.520
accommodate those changes. So to 
updates all NPM packages safely

37
03:59.520 --> 04:09.780
let's run npm update instead.

38
04:09.880 --> 04:13.530
Now if I run and npm outdated again

39
04:17.120 --> 04:27.250
here you'll see the color turns to yellow and you also 
see the same version on current and wanted column.

40
04:27.360 --> 04:27.950
All right

41
04:27.950 --> 04:30.210
the next thing that I want to do is to update font

42
04:30.260 --> 04:30.730
awesome.

43
04:31.220 --> 04:36.260
So when I start building this project I used font awesome version

44
04:36.450 --> 04:39.190
let me see that in package dot

45
04:39.200 --> 04:39.660
json

46
04:43.830 --> 04:48.210
so here I used version 5.0.13

47
04:48.250 --> 04:53.980
Now the reason why I want to update it is to make 
sure that everything is up to date as possible.

48
04:54.120 --> 04:57.290
But if you don't want to updated it, it doesn't matter.

49
04:57.510 --> 05:04.200
Or if you follow the font awesome installation in "New 
Laravel versions reference guide" then you can skip

50
05:04.200 --> 05:05.290
this.

51
05:05.520 --> 05:11.660
So the current version now is 5.11 and 
installing the new one is slightly different.

52
05:12.000 --> 05:17.150
So let me uninstall my old font awesome. I'll copy this

53
05:20.550 --> 05:23.950
and here I'm going to say npm uninstall

54
05:31.070 --> 05:32.090
also this one

55
05:39.960 --> 05:44.800
npm uninstall and paste hit return

56
05:48.370 --> 06:01.620
once that done I can install font awesome svg core 
package by saying npm install fort awesome font

57
06:01.830 --> 06:04.760
awesome svg

58
06:04.950 --> 06:06.570
core dash d

59
06:12.100 --> 06:14.620
then I'll need to install solid icons

60
06:19.340 --> 06:30.960
fort awesome free solid svg icons

61
06:31.000 --> 06:33.190
All right let me go to my editor

62
06:37.070 --> 06:39.380
then open font

63
06:39.430 --> 06:42.140
awesome dot js

64
06:46.000 --> 06:46.600
here

65
06:46.600 --> 06:52.240
firstly I need to import the config library 
and dom from font awesome svg core

66
06:56.360 --> 06:56.650
here

67
06:56.660 --> 06:58.980
I can optionally set config

68
06:59.120 --> 07:02.150
auto replace svg to nest

69
07:04.820 --> 07:06.860
then I can import the font like so

70
07:17.910 --> 07:19.420
and now I can remove this lines

71
07:26.910 --> 07:32.130
and here I no longer need to call font awesome here just library

72
07:32.310 --> 07:32.610
add

73
07:35.820 --> 07:37.770
we can remove with these brackets

74
07:46.670 --> 07:50.600
and last we can say dom watch.

75
07:52.170 --> 07:56.490
This command will find i tags and replace with svg.

76
07:56.520 --> 07:57.430
All right

77
07:57.870 --> 08:02.070
let me set save these change back to terminal

78
08:06.460 --> 08:10.490
and run Laravel mix by saying npm run

79
08:10.560 --> 08:10.980
watch

80
08:14.680 --> 08:15.150
Now here

81
08:15.160 --> 08:21.540
when running the new version of Laravel mix it will 
install other dependencies such as vue template

82
08:21.550 --> 08:22.120
compiler

83
08:26.090 --> 08:34.620
All right let me go to my browser and reload a page. Ups

84
08:35.360 --> 08:42.230
it's look like I made a mistake removing navbar 
laravel css rule in my app dot scss when

85
08:42.230 --> 08:43.150
upgrading laravel app.

86
08:43.960 --> 08:45.260
So let me open that file

87
08:54.040 --> 08:57.670
and here I'll rewrite the css rule for navbar laravel

88
09:01.570 --> 09:05.800
let me save this change back to my browser

89
09:10.100 --> 09:10.700
and reload

90
09:14.080 --> 09:17.130
OK I think it's better.

91
09:17.290 --> 09:24.820
Now let's commit all the changes that we made 
to our git repo. Back to terminal hit control+c

92
09:28.350 --> 09:38.040
and here git and all. git commit -m and I'll say fix

93
09:38.280 --> 09:39.240
vulnerable

94
09:41.730 --> 09:53.650
NPM packages and update font awesome.

95
09:53.700 --> 09:55.510
Now we can switch to monster branch.

96
09:55.560 --> 09:56.040
git

97
09:56.130 --> 09:57.680
checkout master

98
10:00.500 --> 10:06.180
and merge to our latest branch git merge

99
10:06.300 --> 10:09.030
audit npm packages

100
10:14.560 --> 10:18.260
and now let's push the changes in 
our master branch to our remote

101
10:18.270 --> 10:22.460
repo git push origin master.

102
10:30.640 --> 10:35.630
All right now let's finally start our journey 
on building single page application.
