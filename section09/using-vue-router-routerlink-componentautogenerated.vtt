00:02.310 --> 00:08.160
Now let's make a couple of links in this 
navbar so that we can visit the page easily.

1
00:08.190 --> 00:14.190
Let's go back to our editor and then go to spa.blade.php

2
00:21.720 --> 00:28.560
and here in navbar brand instead of using normal anchor 
we can now leverage another component that provided

3
00:28.650 --> 00:29.580
by vue router

4
00:33.330 --> 00:40.490
we can make use router link we can specify the class attribute

5
00:43.410 --> 00:55.720
in this case navbar brand then the most important is `to` attribute.

6
00:55.930 --> 01:00.720
You can think of the to attribute like `href` in anchor tag.

7
01:00.730 --> 01:07.080
So here we can set it to root or because 
we've also name our route path

8
01:07.090 --> 01:21.290
here we can call the name instead of the path. So we need to bind this `to` and pass in an object. Inside

9
01:21.300 --> 01:25.720
here we can simply say name colon path name

10
01:25.740 --> 01:27.000
In this case home

11
01:40.810 --> 01:48.700
now we can get rid of this anchor tag.

12
01:48.790 --> 01:54.630
All right let's add more links.

13
01:54.740 --> 01:58.630
You can put them in the left side or the right side of the navbar

14
02:02.060 --> 02:03.530
here I'll put them in the right side.

15
02:04.970 --> 02:07.460
Firstly here we need to make a list item

16
02:11.980 --> 02:16.480
and it's gonna have a class nav item just bootstrap stuff

17
02:21.940 --> 02:23.700
then inside this list item

18
02:23.700 --> 02:33.740
we can add router link it's gonna have a class bootstrap

19
02:33.800 --> 02:39.410
nav-link then it's going to point to questions route.

20
02:39.650 --> 02:47.020
So here will say to name questions

21
02:51.680 --> 02:54.250
and the text is going to be questions

22
02:59.620 --> 03:01.720
let's duplicate this list item

23
03:06.090 --> 03:18.710
and change the target to my posts 
and change the text to my posts. Okay

24
03:18.830 --> 03:23.960
let's save this change back to the browser

25
03:26.880 --> 03:27.390
reload hit

26
03:30.880 --> 03:31.420
the link

27
03:34.470 --> 03:46.010
we have questions page. Hit this one we have current users post and if we hit the navbar brand we also get

28
03:46.010 --> 03:47.390
the questions page.

29
03:47.460 --> 03:49.250
Great.

30
03:49.320 --> 03:56.490
Now the smal issue that we have here is we don't have proper bootstrap active menu when we switch the pages.

31
03:58.740 --> 03:59.220
Actually

32
03:59.220 --> 04:06.280
here we have different color for active menu but 
this is not the proper way. The proper way is to add

33
04:06.280 --> 04:08.800
bootstrap class in the current menu item.

34
04:08.880 --> 04:10.230
So let's inspect element

35
04:15.980 --> 04:21.740
as you can see vue router inject some classes for the current anchor.

36
04:21.740 --> 04:25.970
But here we need to add active class here in the list item.

37
04:30.370 --> 04:34.550
So as you can see now the menu item marked as active menu.

38
04:34.610 --> 04:35.420
So let's do that

39
04:35.420 --> 04:36.320
in our code.

40
04:37.040 --> 04:38.930
So let's switch back over to our editor

41
04:44.750 --> 04:50.040
and here to attach the active class dynamically when 
the routes changing we cannot use a normal

42
04:50.040 --> 04:51.170
list item tag.

43
04:51.270 --> 04:56.580
So to do that we need to make a bit 
change to this router link components.

44
04:56.580 --> 05:00.620
Here we can change the router link 
behavior by specify the `tag` attribute.

45
05:01.470 --> 05:10.410
Firstly let's get rid of this list item tag in here 
entirely. I can simply select this first list item

46
05:12.510 --> 05:18.120
I'll have command d to select another 
instance then I'll cut the class

47
05:21.750 --> 05:24.000
I'll delete the list item opening tag

48
05:27.640 --> 05:33.220
then I'll go to list item closing  tag then I'll delete them

49
05:36.410 --> 05:41.990
go to the left my hitting command left arrow hit the delete

50
05:44.750 --> 05:49.510
then after router link I'll paste the class

51
05:52.680 --> 06:02.600
and specify tag equals `li` after that I'll cut the old class attribute

52
06:12.690 --> 06:19.190
then I need to add anchor tag inside this 
component. I'll pass a class in here

53
06:24.050 --> 06:26.460
and lastly I need to close the anchor tag

54
06:36.230 --> 06:43.180
so by doing this way the router link component acts 
like list item because we've specify the tag as `li`

55
06:43.200 --> 06:50.480
but here we don't need to move the `to` attribute 
to the anchor because vue router will take care of that

56
06:50.470 --> 06:51.280
for us.

57
06:51.620 --> 06:58.650
Now you might be thinking where we put the active 
class? Well we'll do that later on for now let's save

58
06:58.650 --> 07:01.660
these changes and see in our browser

59
07:12.010 --> 07:13.240
let's inspect element on this

60
07:17.640 --> 07:27.900
here we still have this item and now you'll see in 
here we have router link exact active router link active

61
07:29.100 --> 07:33.130
and you might be wondering where these classes come from?

62
07:33.350 --> 07:39.400
Well actually it's the default classes to indicate 
that the path is matches with the router link.

63
07:39.650 --> 07:43.490
But this is not what we expected 
because we need active class instead.

64
07:44.120 --> 07:47.210
So how can we solve this?

65
07:47.210 --> 07:49.950
Well actually you have two options.

66
07:49.970 --> 07:54.920
First you need to define the router link active class in your css file

67
07:55.010 --> 07:59.560
Second you need to override the router link active to active.

68
07:59.570 --> 08:04.340
So for this case I prefer to take the second option. To do that

69
08:04.340 --> 08:13.130
let's switch back over to our editor then open router index js

70
08:17.250 --> 08:28.940
and here in vue router option we can specify 
link active class equals active that's it.

71
08:29.800 --> 08:34.030
Now if we save this back to our browser

72
08:37.410 --> 08:38.370
and reload the page

73
08:43.160 --> 08:53.900
now you'll see we have the proper active class and 
here we can visually see the active menu item.

74
08:53.940 --> 08:59.530
All right let's move on the next video where we'll see 
how to protect a particular route using vue router

75
08:59.610 --> 09:00.360
navigation guard.
