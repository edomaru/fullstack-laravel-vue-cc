00:02.830 --> 00:03.700
Back to our editor

1
00:07.330 --> 00:15.640
then here let's uncomment this line and 
then let's open the answers component.

2
00:19.950 --> 00:22.960
Let's jump to methods

3
00:26.720 --> 00:27.050
here

4
00:27.060 --> 00:30.050
we need to make a little change to this fetch method.

5
00:33.480 --> 00:36.160
Here instead of data

6
00:36.300 --> 00:42.410
Next page url to this next url here

7
00:42.440 --> 00:46.800
we are going to assign data meta next.

8
00:49.370 --> 00:49.830
Alright

9
00:49.880 --> 00:50.780
let's save all changes

10
00:54.320 --> 01:05.770
back to our browser and reload.

11
01:05.830 --> 01:07.140
Here we have the answers

12
01:10.850 --> 01:12.320
but here we still have error.

13
01:20.310 --> 01:31.710
It's occurred in accept component. So let's go back to 
our editor then let's open answer resource dot php.

14
01:37.650 --> 01:44.820
Here we can include the question instance like we did 
before or because we only need the user id column

15
01:45.420 --> 01:48.030
here I'll add

16
01:48.210 --> 01:49.570
question

17
01:49.710 --> 02:03.410
user id which will hold this question user underscore id.

18
02:03.500 --> 02:06.680
Now we can open our policies.js

19
02:09.910 --> 02:10.960
and here

20
02:11.070 --> 02:17.350
let's change this to answer question

21
02:17.350 --> 02:22.570
user id.

22
02:22.760 --> 02:23.110
All right

23
02:23.570 --> 02:34.330
let's save. Back to our browser and reload.

24
02:34.610 --> 02:35.380
OK

25
02:35.390 --> 02:41.830
now the error is gone.

26
02:41.870 --> 02:48.680
Let me try adding new answer. OK it's still working.

27
02:48.750 --> 02:50.310
Let me go back to all questions.

28
02:55.090 --> 02:56.370
Here i'll create a new question.

29
03:07.360 --> 03:11.950
As you can see that this question since it has no answer

30
03:11.950 --> 03:15.130
we have this delete buttons appears.

31
03:15.160 --> 03:16.600
Now let me show you one issue

32
03:20.470 --> 03:21.730
if I add a new answer

33
03:28.610 --> 03:32.890
you see this delete button is still in there.

34
03:32.890 --> 03:33.760
We don't want that

35
03:34.180 --> 03:38.830
instead we want this button to disappear 
once it has one or more answers.

36
03:42.160 --> 03:47.930
if we reload the page, it is gone.

37
03:48.120 --> 03:48.520
Now

38
03:48.570 --> 03:49.500
let me delete this

39
03:49.500 --> 03:51.950
answer. 

40
03:51.960 --> 03:55.900
Hit yes the answer removed successfully.

41
03:56.670 --> 04:01.460
But again here we have issue on delete 
button. Once it has no answer

42
04:01.590 --> 04:03.420
it still disappear.

43
04:03.420 --> 04:08.650
Probably this is not a big deal. But for me that's not what I want.

44
04:08.670 --> 04:11.830
So that's the first issue that we have here.

45
04:12.000 --> 04:18.210
And then the next issue that I want to 
show you is let me go to all questions.

46
04:22.440 --> 04:26.200
And let me find a question which has some answers.

47
04:30.370 --> 04:43.150
Here let me hit this. So here we have six answers 
and if we hit the load answers. Ups the load answers

48
04:43.180 --> 04:44.780
disappear.

49
04:44.800 --> 04:45.930
Let me go to my editor

50
04:52.550 --> 04:52.860
OK

51
04:52.880 --> 04:57.920
It should be data links next.

52
05:02.730 --> 05:03.150
reload

53
05:06.440 --> 05:07.610
OK.

54
05:07.940 --> 05:13.280
So the issue that I want to show you 
is this load more answers button.

55
05:13.280 --> 05:15.020
Firstly let me add new answer

56
05:18.700 --> 05:19.260
hit submit

57
05:23.590 --> 05:23.890
OK

58
05:23.890 --> 05:24.790
Let me add another one

59
05:36.270 --> 05:38.560
now if we hit this load more answers button

60
05:46.080 --> 05:46.440
OK

61
05:55.390 --> 05:55.710
here

62
05:55.720 --> 05:58.080
we'll have duplicate answers.

63
05:58.270 --> 06:06.160
So basically our new answers will get loaded when 
we hit the button. And last issue that I want to show

64
06:06.160 --> 06:09.940
you is this favorite button.

65
06:09.990 --> 06:16.960
If we hit this it's look like nothing happened. 
But if I open my browser console

66
06:20.400 --> 06:23.040
here I get internal server error.

67
06:23.580 --> 06:25.890
So that are three issues that we need to fix.
