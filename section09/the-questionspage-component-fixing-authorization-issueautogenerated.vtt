Now before we end this lesson let's do one 
more thing. Here I signed in with a user.

1
00:11.160 --> 00:14.620
But I cannot see the edit and delete buttons

2
00:14.850 --> 00:17.520
So what's going on here.

3
00:17.520 --> 00:19.290
Well if we go back to our editor

4
00:23.510 --> 00:25.700
then open policies

5
00:32.380 --> 00:38.110
here we match the user id with model user_id.

6
00:38.110 --> 00:41.440
But if we see our  API response

7
00:47.050 --> 00:50.770
we don't see the user_id in every single question.

8
00:51.250 --> 00:55.220
So to fix this issue you have two options.

9
00:55.300 --> 01:07.270
First you can pull open the question resource and 
here and here just add the user underscore id

10
01:07.270 --> 01:17.100
the second option here in policies dot js we can 
replace all user underscore id with user dot

11
01:17.110 --> 01:18.650
id

12
01:18.820 --> 01:23.860
So I think both options are equally valid but I prefer to choose the second option.

13
01:23.860 --> 01:31.740
So here I'll select all user underscore id and change to user id.

14
01:32.080 --> 01:38.230
So if I save these back to the browser reload

15
01:42.330 --> 01:45.510
all right now I have the edit button appear

16
01:51.400 --> 01:53.630
if delete button still disappear

17
01:53.800 --> 01:59.170
that means the question cannot be removed 
because it has one or more answers on it.

18
02:00.290 --> 02:00.630
All right

19
02:01.240 --> 02:03.850
that's it for this lesson. In the next one

20
02:03.880 --> 02:06.730
we'll be tackling the pagination in our front end.

21
02:06.940 --> 02:07.840
So I'll see you there.
