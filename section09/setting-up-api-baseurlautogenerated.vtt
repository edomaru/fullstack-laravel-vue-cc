In this lesson we are going to consume all questions 
API  endpoint and use it in this questions page

1
00:07.080 --> 00:08.520
component.

2
00:08.530 --> 00:14.320
We already have the UI for displaying all questions 
in blade file so we can easily bring the mark up

3
00:14.320 --> 00:18.820
from there and put them in our questions page component.

4
00:18.820 --> 00:20.410
All right let's go to our terminal

5
00:25.620 --> 00:26.100
and here I'll

6
00:26.140 --> 00:35.070
create a new branch to isolate all changes today.

7
00:35.140 --> 00:39.790
Now let's run laravel mix by saying NPM run watch

8
00:44.240 --> 00:49.590
firstly let's pull open the js bootstrap dot

9
00:49.600 --> 00:50.030
js

10
00:58.340 --> 01:05.700
and here right after this line let's add window

11
01:05.750 --> 01:14.700
axios defaults base URL equals http

12
01:15.410 --> 01:22.910
colon localhost eight thousand api

13
01:23.430 --> 01:30.500
So here we set the base URL to localhost eight thousand api.

14
01:30.990 --> 01:36.420
By doing this way every time we call our API endpoint 
somewhere in our components we don't need to

15
01:36.420 --> 01:38.280
call the full URL.

16
01:38.350 --> 01:41.470
All we have to do is call the rest of the endpoint.

17
01:41.520 --> 01:49.380
For example let's say we want to consume all questions 
endpoint which is localhost eight thousand api

18
01:49.440 --> 01:51.790
questions.

19
01:51.840 --> 01:58.050
Now here we can simply call axios get questions

20
02:02.740 --> 02:11.240
so I hope that will make sense to you. But this code 
probably work only in our development in production

21
02:11.240 --> 02:14.800
the base URL no longer pointed to localhost right?

22
02:14.870 --> 02:17.010
So how can we do that?

23
02:17.090 --> 02:20.270
Well that's very easy actually.

24
02:20.270 --> 02:27.600
Here we can add before this static URL let's say window

25
02:30.310 --> 02:31.180
urls

26
02:33.600 --> 02:39.770
api then we will add double pipes.

27
02:39.780 --> 02:47.580
This means if window dot URLs dot api empty 
or undefined then this static URL is going to be

28
02:47.580 --> 02:51.500
used as axios base URL

29
02:51.530 --> 02:54.740
Now let's pull spa.blade.php

30
02:57.710 --> 03:09.030
and here after window auth let's define window 
dot urls. Now the reason why I call it you URLs

31
03:09.150 --> 03:19.110
instead of API URL is because I might define other 
URL not just for API so window URLs equals

32
03:20.280 --> 03:23.670
and instead of calling json encode

33
03:23.750 --> 03:29.520
actually since laravel version 5. 5 we can 
also use json blade directive like so

34
03:33.450 --> 03:37.740
posse in an array and inside here

35
03:37.770 --> 03:51.340
let's add the api and the value will be taken from url api

36
03:51.340 --> 03:53.650
Let's also change this json encode

37
03:56.630 --> 04:03.940
to json and remove this let's also move this

38
04:08.600 --> 04:09.310
in here

39
04:12.410 --> 04:15.290
then rename to login

40
04:20.030 --> 04:29.850
so here because we move this and changed 
to login let's open router index dot js

41
04:33.120 --> 04:38.850
and change this to window Urls login.

42
04:41.490 --> 04:41.770
Alrihg

43
04:41.780 --> 04:42.760
let several all changes

44
04:47.740 --> 04:51.180
back to our browser and reload.

45
04:52.880 --> 04:56.970
Let me hit this log in. OK

46
04:57.050 --> 04:58.130
It's still working.

47
05:00.270 --> 05:00.670
All right

48
05:00.850 --> 05:04.050
So now that we have our API base URL set up.

49
05:04.050 --> 05:06.880
Now let's working on questions page component.
