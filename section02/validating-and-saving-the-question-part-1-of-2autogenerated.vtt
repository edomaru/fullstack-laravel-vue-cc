00:02.100 --> 00:07.700
In the previous lesson we have built our question form, and added validation error messages in the form markup

1
00:08.100 --> 00:13.710
Now in this lesson we will implement form validation to verify whether the question being asked is valid or

2
00:13.710 --> 00:14.240
not.

3
00:15.240 --> 00:19.020
once we sure that the question is valid we'll save it into our database.

4
00:20.400 --> 00:23.860
All right let's head over to our terminal and by now

5
00:23.880 --> 00:26.240
I'm sure you already are familiar with it stuffs

6
00:26.370 --> 00:30.030
so let's create a new branch git

7
00:30.390 --> 00:37.020
checkout -b and then the branch name will be?

8
00:37.040 --> 00:38.130
That's right

9
00:38.130 --> 00:43.670
lesson-8

10
00:43.720 --> 00:45.400
Now let's head over to our terminal

11
00:48.740 --> 00:52.580
and this time we will be implement form validation in different way

12
00:52.700 --> 00:56.040
we'll define our validation rules outside the controller

13
00:56.320 --> 01:01.610
So we'll write them in separate file and we can call the file as form request

14
01:01.640 --> 01:04.790
and then we call or load it in our controller.

15
01:05.120 --> 01:07.460
this will make our controller a bit cleaner.

16
01:09.040 --> 01:14.830
Actually, defining validation rules in form request is intended for complex scenario. But, I want you

17
01:14.830 --> 01:15.410
learn a lot.

18
01:15.460 --> 01:23.130
So you know many different ways to get things done. OK firstly we need to create the file and in order

19
01:23.130 --> 01:23.690
to do that

20
01:23.740 --> 01:33.430
let's jump to our terminal. And From now on I'll be using visual studio code integrated terminal

21
01:33.490 --> 01:35.890
and I can open it by hitting "ctrl+`"

22
01:39.470 --> 01:51.360
or via menu "View - Integrated terminal". Once it opened the prompt will be our current project and here we can

23
01:51.420 --> 01:55.050
open multiple terminal by hitting this plus button

24
01:59.350 --> 02:05.860
and here we can see the opened terminal in this dropdown, and we can switch from one terminal to another

25
02:06.040 --> 02:08.630
by clicking this dropdown item.

26
02:08.730 --> 02:11.970
All right here in the first terminal I'll run my server

27
02:17.240 --> 02:18.880
php artisan serve

28
02:24.640 --> 02:32.510
OK the server now running. Now I'll switch to my second terminal and I'll use this one to run artisan

29
02:32.520 --> 02:34.340
command.

30
02:34.360 --> 02:40.390
So, if you're not using visual studio code editor or you prefer to use your favorite terminal you can

31
02:40.390 --> 02:41.460
continue using it.

32
02:41.620 --> 02:44.610
But for now on I'll be using this integrated terminal

33
02:47.230 --> 02:55.240
and this maybe no longer used so I'll close it.

34
02:55.250 --> 03:07.400
Alright, here let's generate our form request by typing:
php artisan make:request and then

35
03:07.400 --> 03:12.110
name of our form request. You can name it with any name

36
03:12.290 --> 03:16.690
but I think it's better to contain model name and end with `Request`

37
03:18.360 --> 03:31.270
So in this case let's call it ask question request hit return.

38
03:31.280 --> 03:32.420
Now if we go to app

39
03:36.440 --> 03:46.150
http folder we'll find `Requests` folder and inside it we'll find AskQuestionReqeust.php

40
03:46.170 --> 03:47.270
Let's open this file

41
03:52.210 --> 03:58.580
and inside this file we'll find  `authorize` method which we can read in the comment is to determine if

42
03:58.580 --> 04:01.170
the user is authorized to make this request.

43
04:03.630 --> 04:12.300
for now let's change this to return `true` that's mean all users are authorized to make this request because

44
04:12.330 --> 04:15.210
we only need to define the validation rules

45
04:17.300 --> 04:21.710
in this `rules` method

46
04:21.960 --> 04:27.650
So here we simple define validation rules for our question in the return array

47
04:33.520 --> 04:38.410
so the title will be required

48
04:43.420 --> 04:46.270
and it should be maximum two hundred and fifty five

49
04:54.310 --> 04:55.070
for the body

50
04:55.090 --> 05:01.130
I think we only need it to be required.

51
05:05.060 --> 05:09.720
OK, save that. And now let's open the `QuestionsController`

52
05:20.160 --> 05:21.540
and jump to `store` method

53
05:31.570 --> 05:31.980
here

54
05:32.020 --> 05:40.100
Let's change the type-hint from request to ask question request

55
05:44.890 --> 05:46.310
And that's it

56
05:46.360 --> 05:51.960
we defined the validation rules in AskQuestionRequest and to actually validate the request

57
05:51.970 --> 05:56.920
We need to type hint our method with our form request.

58
05:56.960 --> 06:02.660
so, as I said by doing this our controller will be a bit cleaner because we're separated our validation

59
06:02.660 --> 06:04.070
logic in separate file

60
06:07.200 --> 06:09.140
and here I made mistake

61
06:09.550 --> 06:16.310
It should be ask question request sorry for that.

62
06:16.510 --> 06:18.690
Now here let's show message for a while.

63
06:23.690 --> 06:28.870
So this message will be shown in the requests pass our validation rules.

64
06:28.870 --> 06:31.000
All right let's save this and try that out.

65
06:41.210 --> 06:43.300
Actually here in the top

66
06:43.520 --> 06:44.720
we need to import the file

67
07:03.120 --> 07:09.440
save the change and let's give it a try let's open the question form

68
07:15.070 --> 07:19.140
and here let the form empty and then hit the submit button.

69
07:23.250 --> 07:25.620
Now you can see the validation error messages are appear

70
07:28.270 --> 07:28.850
next

71
07:28.960 --> 07:30.740
Let's enter only the title

72
07:34.650 --> 07:35.310
input

73
07:42.870 --> 07:49.420
and then hit submit button.

74
07:49.450 --> 07:51.210
I got error validate

75
07:51.220 --> 07:54.780
two hundred and fifty five does not exist.

76
07:54.910 --> 07:55.830
Let me check that

77
08:03.440 --> 08:08.530
And of course this should be max two hundred fifty five

78
08:12.370 --> 08:15.950
save and reload again

79
08:19.720 --> 08:22.690
here will get an error message below the question body

80
08:22.690 --> 08:26.970
only we have no error message in the title input now

81
08:27.190 --> 08:33.240
but the problem is we lost the question title that we enter before hitting the submit button

82
08:33.640 --> 08:34.570
So to fix that

83
08:34.630 --> 08:40.580
let's go back to our editor switch to create.blade.php

84
08:51.150 --> 08:53.370
and here in the title input let's

85
08:58.160 --> 08:59.740
specify value attribute

86
09:06.820 --> 09:14.140
and it's value will be populated with old value or value before we hitting submit button

87
09:14.280 --> 09:15.150
So here we can say

88
09:19.530 --> 09:21.250
old

89
09:21.590 --> 09:22.290
title

90
09:27.910 --> 09:28.300
Next

91
09:28.330 --> 09:31.840
let's also do almost the same thing to body textarea

92
09:38.110 --> 09:44.060
here we need to place the old value between textare opening and closing tag

93
09:56.890 --> 09:57.670
let's try again

94
10:02.240 --> 10:02.990
reload the page

95
10:07.090 --> 10:08.490
enter only title input

96
10:14.300 --> 10:19.290
and then hit the submit button.

97
10:19.550 --> 10:25.480
OK now we don't loose our question title.

98
10:25.670 --> 10:27.640
Now let's also enter the question body

99
10:38.310 --> 10:39.860
and then hit the submit button.

100
10:43.610 --> 10:43.990
Alright

101
10:43.990 --> 10:45.630
we have store message show up

102
10:45.760 --> 10:50.680
That's mean our validation is working and we're ready to save the question to our database.
