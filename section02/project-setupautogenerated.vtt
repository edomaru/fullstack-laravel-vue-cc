00:01.110 --> 00:06.630
In this lesson we'll start building our project by installing our fresh Laravel project and then creating

1
00:06.650 --> 00:12.840
Git repository for our project, then configuring the database setting and generating scaffold Authentication

2
00:13.720 --> 00:14.870
all right to start off.

3
00:14.880 --> 00:24.510
Let's go ahead and open our terminal and create new Laravel project by typing laravel new and then the

4
00:24.510 --> 00:32.700
name will be laravel dash Q A or you can name it whatever like hit return

5
00:36.150 --> 00:41.610
this will install packages that laravel depends upon and it usually takes a second or so to install

6
00:55.110 --> 00:55.660
all right

7
00:55.800 --> 01:00.650
After we've successfully created our new laravel project now let's change directory to it.

8
01:01.680 --> 01:10.710
So cd change directory and I'll change to directory laravel-qa.

9
01:10.980 --> 01:16.650
Then here we can create Git repo by firstly initialize the git repository for this project.

10
01:17.640 --> 01:19.360
So git init

11
01:21.820 --> 01:30.120
Next we'll need to add all files in our project to something called staging area git add space

12
01:30.210 --> 01:35.770
dot. and lastly commit all files to our repository

13
01:35.960 --> 01:41.580
Git commit specify a message

14
01:41.900 --> 01:43.610
Initial commit

15
01:47.680 --> 01:48.100
all right

16
01:48.100 --> 01:54.310
We have a local git repository for our project and it will keep track of the changes of our code.

17
01:54.310 --> 02:00.520
Now we can create a remote repository for our project in hosting service providers such as Github.com

18
02:01.240 --> 02:03.170
or Bitbucket.org

19
02:03.190 --> 02:09.520
So if you want to create a private repository then I suggest you to choose bitbucket  because it allows

20
02:09.550 --> 02:14.090
you to create unlimited public and private repositories for free.

21
02:14.350 --> 02:16.510
If you create private repository in GitHub

22
02:16.840 --> 02:23.450
then you need to pay for $7 per month. For this course we are gonna create public repo

23
02:23.710 --> 02:26.050
So choosing github is fine.

24
02:26.170 --> 02:26.580
All right

25
02:26.710 --> 02:32.050
Let's switch over to our browser and I'll enter

26
02:32.060 --> 02:40.290
Github.com.

27
02:40.300 --> 02:42.300
Actually I already have signed in here.

28
02:42.550 --> 02:47.070
So please sign in to your account and if you don't have a account for github

29
02:47.470 --> 02:51.640
then you simply register here is totally free.

30
02:51.640 --> 03:01.330
So here I can create a new repository by hitting this plus button then choose new repository.

31
03:02.780 --> 03:10.800
And here the repository name will be let's say laravel-qa

32
03:15.420 --> 03:23.670
then I'll enter the description with let's say question and answer

33
03:27.930 --> 03:32.360
application built with

34
03:32.720 --> 03:41.440
Laravel five. The repo will be public and that's it.

35
03:41.620 --> 03:43.020
I'll hit the create repository

36
03:49.050 --> 04:00.350
okay here my repository has been created and here we can follow this instruction to push our local

37
04:00.350 --> 04:05.470
repo to this remote repository because we already have our repository.

38
04:05.610 --> 04:07.190
We'll follow this one.

39
04:07.410 --> 04:08.730
I'm gonna copy this one

40
04:11.550 --> 04:15.030
which is basically add remote URL to our local repo

41
04:20.680 --> 04:23.890
and I'll paste it here.

42
04:27.710 --> 04:32.940
And then I'm gonna copy this one and paste here

43
04:43.660 --> 04:47.790
if we have a prompt that asking you to enter your email and password

44
04:47.940 --> 04:53.980
that's because you need to set up the SSH key in your GitHub account.

45
04:54.000 --> 04:59.940
So for now just enter your email and password for your GitHub account and later you can googling how

46
04:59.940 --> 05:08.300
to set up the SSH key. Here it pushed everything in the master branch which is the default branch

47
05:08.390 --> 05:15.260
in local repo to the origin which refers to the remote repository.

48
05:15.260 --> 05:20.810
Now let's head over to our remote repository and refresh the page

49
05:25.160 --> 05:25.970
all right here

50
05:25.980 --> 05:33.010
My local repository has been successfully pushed or uploaded to my remote repository.

51
05:33.020 --> 05:38.440
I hope you also successful pushing your repository to your remote repository in GitHub.

52
05:39.390 --> 05:42.010
Okay great. all right

53
05:42.020 --> 05:47.320
the next thing we should do since we are going to utilize Laravel Mix for asset compilation

54
05:47.430 --> 05:52.260
so let's also install nodejs packages that needed by Laravel mix.

55
05:52.400 --> 06:00.320
We can switch to our terminal and type npm install. Hit return

56
06:04.160 --> 06:04.600
now.

57
06:04.610 --> 06:11.450
Well NPM  downloading all dependency packages because usually it takes sometimes so let's do something

58
06:11.450 --> 06:13.100
else.

59
06:13.100 --> 06:14.270
Let's open new terminal

60
06:18.690 --> 06:32.610
and here lets generate authentication scaffolding by typing php artisan make:auth hit return.

61
06:32.850 --> 06:33.230
All right

62
06:33.440 --> 06:36.310
Authentication scaffolding generated successfully.

63
06:36.310 --> 06:44.410
So basically this command will add a special route for authentication, generate a Home controller and

64
06:44.410 --> 06:46.840
generate the views for authentication.

65
06:47.050 --> 06:48.010
All right.

66
06:48.010 --> 06:51.480
Now let's create a new MySQL database for our project. Here

67
06:51.580 --> 06:58.480
I'll do that using mysql CLI client tool, but of course you can also use graphical user interface

68
06:58.480 --> 07:00.750
tools such as PHPMyAdmin

69
07:00.790 --> 07:02.990
SequalPro or other tools.

70
07:03.430 --> 07:12.260
So mysql -u root here in my machine

71
07:12.260 --> 07:24.120
I have password for the root. So I'll specify -p and then -e probably it stands for execute and

72
07:24.170 --> 07:37.930
the single command to be executed is create create database laravel_qa. Hit return

73
07:41.610 --> 07:42.920
and I'll enter my password.

74
07:44.910 --> 07:45.850
Okay

75
07:45.950 --> 07:47.220
great.

76
07:47.370 --> 07:51.270
So now that we have our new database laravel_qa

77
07:51.390 --> 07:57.580
Now let's configure our database setting in .env file. So let's open our project in our editor

78
07:59.470 --> 07:59.790
here

79
07:59.820 --> 08:01.710
I'll be using Visual studio code

80
08:04.370 --> 08:05.590
so code

81
08:11.140 --> 08:12.200
all right here

82
08:12.200 --> 08:13.780
let's open the .env file

83
08:17.000 --> 08:27.820
first Let's change the DB_DATABASE to laravel_qa.

84
08:27.830 --> 08:42.680
Then the DB_USERNAME would be root. And the password in my machine is 063. Save and one last thing

85
08:42.710 --> 08:48.170
that I'll need to do before running the migrations because currently when I'm recording this video mysql

86
08:48.170 --> 08:55.070
version in my machine is old, so I'll need to open config database

87
08:59.660 --> 09:01.230
jump to mysql

88
09:04.670 --> 09:11.100
and here I'll remove mb4 from charset and collation.

89
09:12.810 --> 09:23.920
So just utf8 and a utf8_unicode_ci. So if I were not doing this I would run into error

90
09:24.030 --> 09:27.500
Specified key was too long when I ran the migration.

91
09:27.740 --> 09:34.610
But as long as you are running mysql version 5.7.7 or higher or MariaDB above

92
09:34.730 --> 09:36.430
10.2.2

93
09:36.710 --> 09:38.830
then you don't need to do this stuff.

94
09:38.920 --> 09:45.400
Okay let's go to our terminal and run the migration

95
09:45.420 --> 09:48.380
by typing php artisan

96
09:48.950 --> 09:49.650
migrate

97
09:57.130 --> 09:58.560
so this is the error

98
09:58.680 --> 10:10.560
Specified key was too long. And I forgot to save this, save. And here I need to fresh the migration

99
10:10.840 --> 10:13.280
fresh hit return

100
10:16.860 --> 10:17.310
all right

101
10:17.320 --> 10:23.580
it created users table and password reset stable.

102
10:23.650 --> 10:27.370
Now if I switch to my first terminal.

103
10:28.060 --> 10:28.570
All right

104
10:28.570 --> 10:34.860
the dependency packages that needed by laravel mix successfully installed. Just to make sure that the

105
10:34.860 --> 10:38.760
project is working fine here in my terminal

106
10:38.910 --> 10:44.770
I'll start the server by typing php artisan serve

107
10:50.950 --> 10:53.170
Here in my browser let me open

108
10:58.890 --> 11:05.840
localhost:8000

109
11:05.940 --> 11:06.710
There we go

110
11:06.720 --> 11:10.600
the Laravel welcome page is showing. All right

111
11:10.650 --> 11:12.150
I think that's enough for this lesson

112
11:12.600 --> 11:17.350
but before we end this lesson, let's save our file changes to our  git repository.

113
11:17.610 --> 11:19.650
So let's switch over to our terminal

114
11:28.520 --> 11:30.570
and here we can see the changes

115
11:30.650 --> 11:33.770
by typing git status.

116
11:34.190 --> 11:37.040
So this whole files should be committed to our repository.

117
11:38.680 --> 11:40.250
Let's add all files

118
11:40.410 --> 11:41.160
Git add .

119
11:44.390 --> 11:45.170
and then commit

120
11:45.180 --> 11:52.450
all changes git commit and describe the changes

121
11:54.970 --> 12:03.820
Generate auth scaffolding and install NPM packages.

122
12:08.820 --> 12:12.860
And lastly let's push our changes to our remote repository.

123
12:13.030 --> 12:15.950
git push origin master

124
12:25.660 --> 12:26.580
Okay great

125
12:26.630 --> 12:31.840
in the next lesson we will create database schema as well as a model for our questions.

126
12:32.010 --> 12:33.300
So I'll see you in a second.
