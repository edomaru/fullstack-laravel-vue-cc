00:03.140 --> 00:09.580
Now, we can add validation error message on the bottom of each input

1
00:09.810 --> 00:11.750
So let's go back to our editor

2
00:18.610 --> 00:21.150
and here bellow title input

3
00:22.730 --> 00:34.160
let's add the validation error. So we can say if errors has title

4
00:37.030 --> 00:45.420
which means if it found error message for title input, we'll show something and remember errors

5
00:45.510 --> 00:47.640
variable will always be available

6
00:47.650 --> 00:57.520
in our views and it hold all error messages.

7
00:58.660 --> 01:02.820
OK here we'll show the message and we'll show it in a div

8
01:06.520 --> 01:16.150
invalid-feedback a bootstrap 4 class that can be used to display validation feedback

9
01:22.860 --> 01:24.230
here

10
01:24.250 --> 01:28.540
We can place the message in the strong tag.

11
01:34.420 --> 01:36.880
And to actually show the message we can say

12
01:41.010 --> 01:47.370
errors first title

13
01:48.970 --> 01:50.540
OK let's copy

14
01:50.540 --> 01:52.100
this validation error

15
01:55.190 --> 01:58.330
And place below textarea

16
02:01.910 --> 02:07.230
select all title and change them to body

17
02:13.020 --> 02:13.520
next

18
02:13.530 --> 02:19.710
We also need to add one more class to each input so that it will make the input and the validation error

19
02:19.710 --> 02:22.350
message in the red color.

20
02:24.940 --> 02:30.980
Actually we need to put it together with a form control class.

21
02:31.210 --> 02:39.640
So here we can select them. In visual studio code, atom or sublime you can do that by hitting ctrl+D

22
02:40.600 --> 02:41.680
And then you can check

23
02:45.380 --> 02:48.140
if title

24
02:52.540 --> 02:53.240
has error

25
03:02.920 --> 03:13.790
we add is-invalid class

26
03:14.860 --> 03:19.570
otherwise we just add empty string.

27
03:20.140 --> 03:23.060
Of course we need to change these to body

28
03:28.710 --> 03:29.830
Save that.

29
03:30.260 --> 03:34.340
And now if we reload to page

30
03:38.560 --> 03:44.530
we will not see any difference because the validation error messages will only appear if the request that

31
03:44.530 --> 03:48.150
we sent do not pass the given validation rules.

32
03:48.460 --> 03:52.030
Right now we haven't defined any validation rules yet

33
03:52.030 --> 03:53.560
So if we click the submit button

34
03:57.890 --> 04:03.420
we'll got this error, because we need to define `csrf_token` in our form

35
04:03.520 --> 04:05.260
So let's go back to our form

36
04:12.890 --> 04:21.440
and here we can add `csrf` like so save

37
04:22.510 --> 04:30.170
back to our form, reload once again and hit the submit button

38
04:32.950 --> 04:36.550
now will only get blank page like this.

39
04:36.550 --> 04:42.510
All right so now we have a question form but to make it actually working we'll do at least two things.

40
04:42.550 --> 04:47.740
first we need to define validation rules to make sure that
the question that entered in our form

41
04:48.130 --> 04:49.680
is what we expected.

42
04:49.960 --> 04:56.380
And the second after we sure that the question we received is valid then we'll save it into our database

43
04:56.950 --> 04:59.290
and we'll do that in the next lesson.

44
05:00.000 --> 05:04.710
And before we close this lesson let's save our work into our git repository.

45
05:04.710 --> 05:06.060
Let's go back to our terminal

46
05:10.200 --> 05:17.520
and hear we can say git add all. git commit

47
05:17.650 --> 05:19.430
dash m

48
05:19.530 --> 05:34.010
And I'll say build a question form. Then I'll push my current branch to my remote repo: git push origin

49
05:34.870 --> 05:43.980
lesson-7

50
05:44.230 --> 05:51.950
And then we can switch to our master branch git checkout master and then merge the master

51
05:51.980 --> 05:58.610
branch to lesson-7 branch git merge lesson-7

52
06:02.020 --> 06:03.010
and last

53
06:03.430 --> 06:08.270
let's push our branch to remote repo git push origin

54
06:08.470 --> 06:08.860
master

55
06:16.250 --> 06:17.240
OK great.
