00:02.620 --> 00:04.110
Now let's save this file

1
00:09.120 --> 00:11.750
and we'll call it edit.blade.php

2
00:17.540 --> 00:27.340
here we need to change the header to edit question

3
00:27.390 --> 00:35.430
We don't need to change this link just skip that.

4
00:36.520 --> 00:47.070
And here let's change the form action to questions dot update and pass the question instance or question

5
00:47.070 --> 00:52.780
id.

6
00:53.440 --> 01:03.460
Now here the http method of questions dot update needs to be put so let me show you again the routes

7
01:24.970 --> 01:33.130
as we can see here the method is put or patch.

8
01:33.470 --> 01:43.780
But here we cannot change this method to put like so because it will not work.

9
01:43.790 --> 01:51.500
Instead we keep this method as post an inside this form

10
01:56.750 --> 01:57.530
we can define

11
02:00.720 --> 02:02.270
method field

12
02:06.270 --> 02:08.930
put like this.

13
02:08.970 --> 02:15.210
This will generate hidden input called the _method and the value is put once with some in the

14
02:15.210 --> 02:19.910
form of will we all recognize that we send a put request.

15
02:20.110 --> 02:34.510
OK last Let's change the button's text to Update question. Save the changes and let's see in our browser

16
02:37.240 --> 02:38.550
back to all questions

17
02:41.170 --> 02:43.090
and click the edit button.

18
02:47.150 --> 02:51.800
Ok now we have our edit question show up

19
02:51.800 --> 03:01.590
the title is edit question, the submit button is update question.

20
03:01.690 --> 03:03.370
Now if we see the source

21
03:11.130 --> 03:12.270
and find the form

22
03:17.410 --> 03:19.000
we'll see here

23
03:19.810 --> 03:29.450
As I said there's a hidden input _method with the value put. OK

24
03:33.330 --> 03:39.930
one thing that we need to do in our edit form is to show the current questions information into

25
03:39.930 --> 03:42.020
the form inputs right?

26
03:42.180 --> 03:45.500
So here and here.

27
03:45.580 --> 03:51.160
So let's go back to our editor switch to form

28
03:51.190 --> 03:52.060
blade php

29
03:57.390 --> 04:01.370
and here in the title input we have level old function calling.

30
04:01.470 --> 04:08.040
As I said this function will retrieve flash input from the previous request and this function actually

31
04:08.070 --> 04:11.370
receive a second argument as default value.

32
04:11.370 --> 04:13.140
So in this case

33
04:16.430 --> 04:18.910
we simply pass in the question title

34
04:19.030 --> 04:20.410
as the second argument like

35
04:20.660 --> 04:31.280
So. Sorry question title and let's do the same thing to the question body.

36
04:45.420 --> 04:55.140
Save that and then reload the page

37
04:55.230 --> 04:55.690
Alright

38
04:55.710 --> 05:05.940
Now the title and the body has been populated with old questions information. Next let's try to change the

39
05:05.940 --> 05:06.450
title

40
05:13.650 --> 05:20.410
then click the submit button. As you may guess this will produce a blank page.

41
05:20.790 --> 05:22.990
So let's go back to our editor one more time

42
05:30.400 --> 05:32.730
Jump to update method.

43
05:36.130 --> 05:39.060
First we need to validate the request right?

44
05:39.130 --> 05:51.420
And here we simply change the type-hint of the first parameter from request to ask question request

45
05:55.020 --> 06:09.290
and inside this method we simply say question update and then pass in the new title and body of the question.

46
06:19.660 --> 06:22.870
And don't forget to redirect to all questions.

47
06:29.200 --> 06:33.980
As I said in redirect function you can pass the URI

48
06:38.480 --> 06:41.260
or chaining it with route method call

49
06:41.600 --> 06:45.250
as we did in store method

50
06:50.140 --> 06:58.600
after that we set up flash message.

51
06:58.970 --> 07:06.490
let's say your question has been updated.

52
07:09.670 --> 07:14.480
Save that and reload the page

53
07:17.690 --> 07:19.160
hit continue.

54
07:22.840 --> 07:26.060
All right here the update message appear

55
07:26.620 --> 07:31.240
and the question title has changed.

56
07:31.270 --> 07:32.600
Let's try one more time

57
07:35.460 --> 07:36.930
edit any question

58
07:38.110 --> 07:39.550
change the title

59
07:43.710 --> 07:45.780
the body as well

60
07:48.430 --> 07:50.390
And hit update question button.

61
08:04.490 --> 08:10.070
Alright, we have successfully extended the functionality of our question form so that we can create

62
08:10.070 --> 08:15.580
new question and update existing question and that's it for this lesson.

63
08:15.580 --> 08:19.200
Don't forget to save your work to git repo

64
08:19.300 --> 08:22.040
I'll flip over to my terminal

65
08:29.300 --> 08:31.720
git add all

66
08:35.370 --> 08:45.400
git commit -m and I'll say extend the form functionality

67
08:50.150 --> 08:54.520
to be able to update

68
08:54.840 --> 08:55.410
Question

69
09:00.750 --> 09:03.110
and then push the current branch

70
09:14.440 --> 09:16.450
switch to master branch

71
09:21.940 --> 09:24.310
And then merge to lesson 9

72
09:32.140 --> 09:37.280
And last push our master branch git push

73
09:37.420 --> 09:45.220
origin master

74
09:45.470 --> 09:46.310
OK great.

75
09:46.310 --> 09:47.560
I'll see you in the next lesson.
