00:01.490 --> 00:08.400
In this lesson we will be adding some counters to indicate number of votes, answers and  views of a question

1
00:09.040 --> 00:15.640
and we'll write some sass code to style our project and then compile it using laravel mix.

2
00:15.650 --> 00:16.430
All right

3
00:16.430 --> 00:18.420
As always before we move on

4
00:18.490 --> 00:20.820
let's isolate our work into a new branch

5
00:20.900 --> 00:23.840
Let's switch over to our terminal

6
00:25.820 --> 00:28.170
and here we can type: git

7
00:28.250 --> 00:30.540
checkout -b

8
00:30.830 --> 00:39.290
and then the branch name will be `lesson-6`

9
00:39.290 --> 00:40.190
All right

10
00:40.310 --> 00:41.870
let's head over to our editor

11
00:46.850 --> 00:48.230
open index.blade.php

12
00:55.670 --> 00:58.620
We'll place them on the left side of the question

13
00:58.700 --> 01:06.520
so here before these let's add a new div

14
01:14.610 --> 01:28.380
and give it class `d-flex`, a flexbox class provided by bootstrap. And then `flex-column` to place the content

15
01:28.500 --> 01:32.070
in vertical direction.

16
01:32.070 --> 01:36.010
and we also need to add custom class so that we can make some styling

17
01:36.330 --> 01:40.110
let's call it `counters` like so.

18
01:44.200 --> 01:47.090
Inside here

19
01:47.160 --> 01:48.230
Let's add another div

20
01:53.150 --> 01:57.590
and give it class `vote`

21
01:57.710 --> 01:59.630
this will be hold the number of votes

22
02:07.160 --> 02:10.560
let's place the number in `strong` tag strong

23
02:15.960 --> 02:28.750
then the number of votes

24
02:29.390 --> 02:32.940
We can also utilize laravel str_plural helper function

25
02:33.020 --> 02:36.150
In this case so that it can be singular or plural

26
02:36.180 --> 02:41.110
based on the number specified

27
02:44.600 --> 02:47.870
So str_plural

28
02:51.110 --> 02:54.890
then `vote` in singular and pass the question's votes

29
03:05.070 --> 03:11.820
OK let's duplicate this

30
03:13.800 --> 03:16.650
and change the class to `status` 

31
03:16.650 --> 03:17.220
In this case

32
03:23.580 --> 03:27.600
change the number to question answers

33
03:31.110 --> 03:36.060
and change the text to answer.

34
03:39.190 --> 03:40.600
Let's duplicate one more time

35
03:43.700 --> 03:46.930
and change the class to view

36
03:50.260 --> 03:56.570
and here we don't need to put the number in the `strong` tag because we'll make it a little different

37
04:10.020 --> 04:13.430
Here let's change the number to views

38
04:18.350 --> 04:23.300
and change the text to view.

39
04:24.350 --> 04:27.170
And here let's put them into one single command

40
04:30.710 --> 04:36.700
and separate it with a space like so.

41
04:37.740 --> 04:43.270
OK let's save that and see how it looked like.

42
04:49.050 --> 04:49.670
All right

43
04:50.890 --> 04:54.120
the counter placed on the left side as  expected.

44
04:54.130 --> 04:59.680
Now it's time to style them. Let's go back to our editor

45
05:03.700 --> 05:15.720
and navigate to resources assets sass folder. Then open `app.scss`

46
05:16.480 --> 05:22.040
We've defined counter class in here.

47
05:22.360 --> 05:24.660
So now let's select this

48
05:28.690 --> 05:30.840
counters

49
05:31.710 --> 05:35.570
first I need more space between counters and the answer

50
05:36.280 --> 05:40.000
so margin-right

51
05:45.130 --> 05:46.150
and I think

52
05:46.430 --> 05:47.710
thirty pixel is is enough

53
05:50.800 --> 05:55.960
then let's decrease the font size: font-size

54
05:58.480 --> 06:08.560
let's say 10px and then change the text align to center: text-align

55
06:11.220 --> 06:13.080
center

56
06:17.010 --> 06:19.430
several all changes.

57
06:19.460 --> 06:22.090
Now if we tried to reload the page

58
06:25.830 --> 06:31.680
we'll not find any changes in our page. This because we need to compile our sass code to normal css

59
06:31.690 --> 06:34.860
code that can be recognized by browser.

60
06:35.200 --> 06:37.780
So to do that let's head over to our terminal

61
06:41.700 --> 06:42.310
and type

62
06:44.970 --> 06:46.670
npm run dev

63
06:46.740 --> 06:49.190
hit return.

64
06:52.150 --> 06:59.100
So this command will tell `webpack`, a node package manager to compile all assets our sass code,

65
06:59.120 --> 07:04.510
javascript code and then produce new files than can be recognized by browser.

66
07:04.960 --> 07:06.820
Let me go back to editor

67
07:10.420 --> 07:15.220
and open webpack.mix.js

68
07:20.730 --> 07:25.370
and this file is basically a simple configuration file for webpack.

69
07:25.380 --> 07:33.680
as you can see, in the first line laravel-mix is called. Laravel mix itself is a wrapper for web

70
07:33.690 --> 07:35.760
pack. In the official documentation

71
07:35.790 --> 07:44.090
It says "it provides a clean, fluent API for defining basic webpack build steps for our Laravel application"

72
07:46.990 --> 07:54.630
OK, then below that we can see what file will be compiled
and where the output will be.

73
07:54.650 --> 08:07.020
So whenever we run NPM run command this javascript file will get compiled and the compiled file will be

74
08:07.020 --> 08:10.330
stored in public js folder.

75
08:10.560 --> 08:13.710
In this case the file name will be the same app dot

76
08:13.840 --> 08:18.840
js if the file was exist then it will be overwritten

77
08:21.500 --> 08:29.250
That's the same thing to the sass file in 'resources/assets/sass/app.scss' it will be compiled

78
08:29.370 --> 08:33.190
and then stored the compiled file

79
08:33.210 --> 08:40.180
in this case it will be `app.css` in public css folder.

80
08:40.180 --> 08:49.880
Now if now if we open `views/layouts/app.blade.php`

81
08:54.540 --> 08:56.720
we can see the compiled files are loaded.

82
08:56.940 --> 09:02.730
So this one and this one.

83
09:02.970 --> 09:08.820
So, that's why we need to run `npm run dev` to see the changes in our page, because what we written in

84
09:08.820 --> 09:14.270
`assets` need be compiled, and in this file we reference the compiled files.

85
09:14.850 --> 09:15.690
OK let's see

86
09:22.400 --> 09:25.330
now we can see the changes the font size

87
09:25.340 --> 09:32.910
now a little bit smaller, they are centered, and we have more space between counters and question.

88
09:35.090 --> 09:38.850
Alright, let's style this vote and answer counter.

89
09:39.230 --> 09:40.610
Let's go back to our editor

90
09:43.490 --> 09:45.450
and back to app dot 

91
09:45.560 --> 09:56.900
scss and here I want to make the same with and height for vote and answer so I can write like so: vote

92
09:59.210 --> 10:01.180
answer

93
10:03.630 --> 10:04.400
and here let's set the width

94
10:07.280 --> 10:09.130
let's say 60 pixels

95
10:12.800 --> 10:16.190
and the height also 60 pixels

96
10:18.920 --> 10:25.880
and for now I'll define border one pixel solid red

97
10:29.550 --> 10:31.790
Save!

98
10:31.830 --> 10:35.610
Now here we need to compile the code again to see the changes.

99
10:35.990 --> 10:41.990
But, I think it would not be practical to compile the code whenever we make changes in our assets, right?

100
10:42.290 --> 10:48.190
Luckily laravel has provide another option so that 
whenever we make changes it would be compiled

101
10:48.370 --> 10:52.690
automatically.

102
10:52.910 --> 11:02.680
so here instead of calling `npm run dev`, now we can call `npm run watch`

103
11:02.800 --> 11:10.460
So this command will watch our assets changes and then get compiled automatically and it will take some

104
11:10.460 --> 11:11.850
time to compiled.

105
11:19.630 --> 11:26.350
OK reload the page. OK here the change.

106
11:26.370 --> 11:35.940
Now let's make further styling. Here I'll make the number and text of this `votes` and `answer` in stacked.

107
11:41.050 --> 11:44.100
here in the counter

108
11:46.400 --> 11:47.970
let's select the `strong` tag

109
11:52.510 --> 11:54.330
and then change the display to block

110
11:59.190 --> 12:01.590
then I'll make the font size a little bigger

111
12:04.540 --> 12:09.180
I think 2 em is enough

112
12:10.470 --> 12:18.310
And we don't need these red border again just remove it.

113
12:18.540 --> 12:24.720
Save changes.

114
12:24.720 --> 12:27.470
Now it will be compiled automatically.

115
12:27.470 --> 12:29.430
Let's see the change

116
12:33.650 --> 12:35.410
alright I think

117
12:35.450 --> 12:36.660
so far so good.
