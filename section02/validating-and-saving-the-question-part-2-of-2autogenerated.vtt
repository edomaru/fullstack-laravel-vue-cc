00:02.660 --> 00:04.430
Let's go back to `QuestionsController`

1
00:16.760 --> 00:18.520
and here let's get rid of this message

2
00:21.900 --> 00:28.500
then to save the question because the question is belongs to a user or created by user so we can get the

3
00:28.500 --> 00:29.880
current user by calling

4
00:32.440 --> 00:33.510
request user

5
00:36.510 --> 00:46.810
and then call `questions` method to obtain an instance of our relationship

6
00:53.400 --> 00:55.060
and then call `create` method

7
01:01.320 --> 01:06.150
This will automatically add the appropriate user_id value to the new question model

8
01:09.030 --> 01:14.050
and the last we need to pass the question that we enter in the form to this `create` method

9
01:14.940 --> 01:15.810
Here we can say

10
01:20.190 --> 01:33.320
request all like so to get all inputs or we can do it explicitly by calling request only and then specify

11
01:33.320 --> 01:34.130
the request input

12
01:43.640 --> 01:44.180
and the last

13
01:44.210 --> 01:55.890
after we have successfully created new question we'll redirect to question index.

14
01:57.040 --> 02:03.430
So return redirect and then the URI will be questions

15
02:06.080 --> 02:07.250
or we can also say

16
02:10.770 --> 02:12.960
redirect route

17
02:18.090 --> 02:20.580
questions index like this.

18
02:22.150 --> 02:34.710
So so again, if you're unsure with your routes just go to your terminal and type: php artisan route:list

19
02:38.260 --> 02:39.450
and then filter by name

20
02:53.130 --> 03:01.080
here you can pass the URI in the redirect function or chain with route method and specify the route

21
03:01.100 --> 03:04.860
name

22
03:05.890 --> 03:06.360
OK

23
03:06.390 --> 03:14.820
OK, last we'll need to define a flash message we can do that by calling `with` method

24
03:15.220 --> 03:17.710
then the key will be success

25
03:19.570 --> 03:28.260
and the value let's say your question has been submitted.

26
03:32.140 --> 03:35.970
Save and before we try that

27
03:35.970 --> 03:38.340
actually there's two things that we need to do.

28
03:38.340 --> 03:42.650
First we need to show the flash message that is stored in session to our view

29
03:42.690 --> 03:43.440
right?

30
03:43.440 --> 03:44.880
So let's go to

31
03:47.680 --> 03:48.860
resources

32
03:51.370 --> 04:03.650
views layouts folder and here let's create a new file

33
04:03.810 --> 04:07.530
lat's save it as _messages.blade.php

34
04:13.580 --> 04:18.210
The file name prefixed with underscore to indicate that this file is partial file.

35
04:18.630 --> 04:20.390
But actually this is not necessary

36
04:23.580 --> 04:26.300
here we simply write if

37
04:30.300 --> 04:31.460
session success

38
04:35.480 --> 04:40.460
or we can say if any value which has key 'success' found in session

39
04:46.380 --> 04:51.500
then we'll display it in alert. Here, let's utilize bootstrap alert

40
04:51.830 --> 04:54.550
And we want it to be able to close it right away.

41
04:54.800 --> 04:56.600
so, let's go to bootstrap homepage

42
05:04.270 --> 05:05.440
getbootstrap.com

43
05:08.950 --> 05:14.650
and then go to the communication.

44
05:14.780 --> 05:18.640
And here in the search box let's type alert

45
05:22.320 --> 05:23.120
choose this one

46
05:27.310 --> 05:31.380
then in the right side let's click dismissing menu

47
05:37.820 --> 05:39.720
we can see how it looked like.

48
05:39.740 --> 05:41.410
So here we can see the alert

49
05:46.520 --> 05:54.070
and we can close it by clicking this icon so let's click this button to copy the markup to a clipboard.

50
05:57.900 --> 05:58.900
And paste here.

51
06:08.130 --> 06:12.460
change the alert type to `alert-success`

52
06:15.760 --> 06:23.120
change the text in the strong tag to success.

53
06:27.600 --> 06:30.000
And change the message with actuall message in session

54
06:39.200 --> 06:44.270
so session success.

55
06:44.440 --> 06:56.150
Alright, Now let's open index.blade.php file. And here we'll show the message on the top of our question list so we can

56
06:56.150 --> 06:59.410
put it inside this card body

57
07:03.140 --> 07:05.900
and then let's call our message partial like so

58
07:08.420 --> 07:14.170
include layouts dot underscore messages

59
07:30.280 --> 07:36.610
don't forget to save all changes.

60
07:37.660 --> 07:39.460
And now we can go back to all our browser

61
07:46.470 --> 07:46.990
OK

62
07:46.990 --> 07:49.870
The second thing that we need to do is we need to log in.

63
07:49.870 --> 07:50.570
right?

64
07:50.650 --> 07:53.070
As you remember that the question is belongs to the user

65
07:56.590 --> 08:06.130
So if we try to reload the page, and then hit continue. We'll got error like this

66
08:06.140 --> 08:07.970
So let's go back to previous page

67
08:14.130 --> 08:15.110
and then hit Logan

68
08:20.520 --> 08:21.500
actually.

69
08:21.500 --> 08:24.920
I don't remember the user's email so let me open thinker

70
08:30.150 --> 08:32.050
php artisan tinker

71
08:36.520 --> 08:36.840
here

72
08:36.860 --> 08:38.530
I'll get the first users's email

73
08:47.150 --> 08:47.650
OK

74
08:47.670 --> 08:48.680
I'll copy this email

75
08:53.360 --> 08:55.480
and paste here.

76
08:59.860 --> 09:02.940
And I'm sure the password is secret.

77
09:11.330 --> 09:13.400
And now let's go to questions page

78
09:18.460 --> 09:20.710
and then create new question

79
09:20.710 --> 09:24.340
Actually here I have my first question in the list.

80
09:24.340 --> 09:27.280
I entered it before recording and I forgot to delete it

81
09:37.380 --> 09:38.570
enter the question title

82
09:42.230 --> 09:43.500
and then question body

83
09:48.080 --> 09:49.790
and hit asked this question button

84
09:57.190 --> 09:58.310
All right we have success

85
09:58.320 --> 10:05.540
message show up and we can see our new question successfully created and added here.

86
10:05.580 --> 10:06.660
OK great.

87
10:06.660 --> 10:12.030
Now our question form is working perfectly it able to validate the question and able to save the valid

88
10:12.090 --> 10:13.780
question to our database.

89
10:14.070 --> 10:16.520
So with that I'll jump to my terminal

90
10:26.320 --> 10:27.830
see all the changes we made.

91
10:35.940 --> 10:36.750
git add all

92
10:40.790 --> 10:42.820
git commit

93
10:58.170 --> 10:59.300
push the current branch

94
11:20.880 --> 11:22.550
switch to master branch

95
11:29.710 --> 11:34.260
merge to lesson-8

96
11:37.710 --> 11:42.890
And last push out master branch

97
11:50.530 --> 11:56.260
Alright in the next lesson we'll extend the functionality of our form so that it also able to use to update

98
11:56.350 --> 11:57.130
existing question.
