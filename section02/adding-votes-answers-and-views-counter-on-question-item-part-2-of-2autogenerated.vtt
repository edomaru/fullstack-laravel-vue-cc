00:03.080 --> 00:10.250
Now, let's style this `status` counter.
Here we'll need three styles for three conditions.

1
00:10.250 --> 00:13.180
The first condition when the question has no answer

2
00:13.490 --> 00:17.200
this counter will look like this no border at all.

3
00:17.330 --> 00:22.610
Then a second one when the question has been answered it has green border.

4
00:22.700 --> 00:29.060
And then the third one when the question has been answered and accepted as best answer it has a green

5
00:29.060 --> 00:30.350
background.

6
00:30.350 --> 00:32.440
All right let's go back to our editor

7
00:36.850 --> 00:39.830
and here we need to define at least two variables.

8
00:40.000 --> 00:43.180
So let's open this variables dot

9
00:43.550 --> 00:44.670
scss

10
00:47.560 --> 00:47.980
And here

11
00:48.010 --> 00:49.530
Let's define a variable

12
00:49.630 --> 00:59.050
let's say `color-green` and the color in `rgb`

13
01:02.540 --> 01:10.410
95 for red 187 for green

14
01:12.890 --> 01:17.660
and one hundred twenty six for the blue

15
01:22.440 --> 01:27.020
this will result a light green color

16
01:27.980 --> 01:33.960
then the second variable will be `color-white`

17
01:35.820 --> 01:43.640
then the value we can simply use hexadecimal

18
01:43.710 --> 01:53.530
Now back to `app.scss` and here in `counters` let's select `status` class

19
02:01.690 --> 02:17.390
and inside this, let's define other class. Here we start with ampersand and then the class name `unanswered`

20
02:17.590 --> 02:20.440
This will make sure that this class is not stand alone

21
02:20.440 --> 02:22.230
I mean it should be called like these

22
02:24.960 --> 02:32.960
class `status unanswered` like this.

23
02:33.310 --> 02:37.930
OK

24
02:40.360 --> 02:47.770
and here we simply define border none. Next

25
02:47.800 --> 02:48.880
let's define another class

26
02:52.160 --> 02:52.480
answered

27
02:57.650 --> 03:00.480
and here will make green border so border

28
03:03.120 --> 03:09.900
one pixel solid and then `color-green`.

29
03:13.830 --> 03:14.390
And last

30
03:14.420 --> 03:21.010
let's also set the text color to green: color `color-green`.

31
03:24.010 --> 03:25.080
Last

32
03:25.130 --> 03:29.820
Let's define another class ampersand dot

33
03:32.770 --> 03:33.760
answered

34
03:36.580 --> 03:36.960
accepted

35
03:41.830 --> 03:45.170
here we don't need to set border color

36
03:45.290 --> 03:48.250
Instead we need to change the background color to green.

37
03:48.330 --> 03:53.160
So background `color-green`

38
03:56.800 --> 04:08.040
and we need to change the text color to white: color `color-white`. Save the changes

39
04:10.500 --> 04:11.020
also

40
04:14.260 --> 04:20.470
here I got error because I I haven't save this. So save that

41
04:23.420 --> 04:25.880
OK now will successfully

42
04:29.270 --> 04:29.760
now

43
04:29.810 --> 04:32.310
now let's try to apply this classes in our view

44
04:38.690 --> 04:40.550
actually we don't need to try

45
04:40.610 --> 04:48.150
unanswered class because it will make any difference. Here let's just add answered

46
04:53.860 --> 04:54.250
save.

47
04:57.840 --> 04:58.640
reload the page

48
05:04.350 --> 05:09.450
and oh here we have green border on Answer counter.

49
05:09.630 --> 05:10.980
Now let's try another class

50
05:14.980 --> 05:18.530
here let's change this to answered

51
05:19.080 --> 05:21.850
accepted. Save

52
05:24.900 --> 05:28.520
reload the page.

53
05:28.530 --> 05:29.270
All right

54
05:29.430 --> 05:38.450
now we have green background on answer counter.
Here I think we need to add more space between answer

55
05:38.620 --> 05:41.100
and views counter

56
05:41.350 --> 05:44.820
so here

57
05:48.240 --> 05:51.850
let's define another class 

58
05:51.990 --> 05:54.300
outside status

59
05:54.690 --> 05:55.080
view

60
05:57.970 --> 06:00.450
and here let's set margin to to

61
06:03.700 --> 06:06.480
let's say 10 pixels

62
06:10.330 --> 06:10.740
save

63
06:14.490 --> 06:18.840
it get compiled. Reload again

64
06:21.470 --> 06:24.030
OK great. Last

65
06:24.080 --> 06:30.450
let's actually apply the style for this answer counter dynamically

66
06:30.540 --> 06:33.010
So do that let's go back to our editor

67
06:37.180 --> 06:38.860
go to index.blade.php

68
06:43.990 --> 06:47.980
and change this to

69
06:50.740 --> 06:51.430
question

70
06:55.410 --> 06:56.900
let's say status

71
07:00.540 --> 07:02.790
then let's open question model

72
07:14.060 --> 07:17.200
and here let's define a new accessor

73
07:22.740 --> 07:26.370
So remember an accessor always start with `get`

74
07:27.240 --> 07:33.930
and then attribute name, in this case `status` and end with Attribute

75
07:41.730 --> 07:46.120
here we need to return three different classes for three conditions

76
07:46.120 --> 07:54.730
So if and then we check is the `answers` is great than zero

77
08:02.940 --> 08:09.640
then we return answered class

78
08:13.410 --> 08:17.020
and here we also need to check if the best answer Id is not

79
08:17.020 --> 08:36.670
null here we can write if this best answer Id like this

80
08:39.720 --> 08:41.010
and then return

81
08:43.800 --> 08:46.850
answered accepted

82
08:46.850 --> 08:47.190
class

83
08:51.750 --> 08:52.540
and lastly

84
08:56.990 --> 08:59.380
outside if statement that's mean

85
08:59.410 --> 09:00.810
there's no answer

86
09:00.850 --> 09:04.090
We return unanswered

87
09:09.890 --> 09:12.210
OK save

88
09:14.590 --> 09:15.440
actually

89
09:15.520 --> 09:16.920
let's save all changes.

90
09:23.450 --> 09:23.970
Reload the page

91
09:27.960 --> 09:42.390
as you can see now the style has been applied dynamically to question.

92
09:42.680 --> 09:44.390
Let me open phpmyadmin

93
09:47.550 --> 09:49.630
here I'll see my questions

94
09:53.560 --> 10:03.650
Now I'll change one of them and the answer will be zero.

95
10:03.740 --> 10:09.780
Save and reload again.

96
10:14.720 --> 10:15.650
OK

97
10:15.830 --> 10:21.190
As you can see now the style has been applied dynamically to question's answer counter.

98
10:21.200 --> 10:21.730
All right

99
10:21.830 --> 10:24.160
I think it's enough for this lesson.

100
10:24.320 --> 10:26.730
Let's save our work to our git repository.

101
10:26.780 --> 10:28.370
Let's switch to our terminal

102
10:32.450 --> 10:38.540
here we need to stop laravel mix otherwise our assets will get compelled when we switch to master

103
10:38.540 --> 10:39.250
branch

104
10:39.560 --> 10:42.530
So I'll hit Control C to stop

105
10:46.010 --> 10:49.930
and now we can type: git add all

106
10:52.940 --> 10:56.270
git commit -m

107
10:57.130 --> 11:01.430
And I'll say add votes, answer and

108
11:05.940 --> 11:07.560
views counter

109
11:10.350 --> 11:12.360
to question item

110
11:18.120 --> 11:24.170
then I'll push my current branch to remote repo. git push origin

111
11:24.510 --> 11:32.730
lesson-6

112
11:33.210 --> 11:37.190
OK now we can switch to our master branch. git

113
11:37.290 --> 11:39.620
checkout master.

114
11:40.380 --> 11:47.100
And then merge the master branch to the lesson-6 branch: git merge

115
11:47.520 --> 11:50.730
lesson-6

116
11:53.570 --> 11:54.640
and last 

117
11:54.670 --> 11:58.780
push our master branch to our remote repo: git push origin

118
11:58.890 --> 11:59.280
master

119
12:06.180 --> 12:07.500
Okay great in the

120
12:07.650 --> 12:12.180
next lesson we'll be continue our coding journey by building question form.

121
12:12.390 --> 12:13.990
So join me there.
