00:01.540 --> 00:07.130
In the previous lesson we have finally completed the first stage in building our project which is displaying

1
00:07.130 --> 00:10.330
all questions from our database to our application. 

2
00:10.320 --> 00:15.960
I'm sure, so far You have learned many things or at least you have reviewed what you have learned before.

3
00:15.990 --> 00:19.230
Now it's time to continue into the next stage in building our project.

4
00:19.410 --> 00:23.290
that is adding new feature that allows us to create new question.

5
00:23.700 --> 00:29.040
So in this lesson we're building the question form, and we'll continue validating the form and saving the

6
00:29.040 --> 00:31.520
question to database in the next lesson.

7
00:33.250 --> 00:38.700
Alright, let's open up our terminal and again here

8
00:38.710 --> 00:41.760
let's create a new branch: git

9
00:42.200 --> 00:44.760
checkout -b

10
00:45.080 --> 00:48.720
and then the branch name will be `lesson-7`

11
00:52.510 --> 00:53.410
OK

12
00:53.520 --> 00:57.900
firstly let's add a button on the top right here

13
00:57.960 --> 01:03.740
this button will be "ask question", a button to create new question.

14
01:03.870 --> 01:05.670
All right let's head over to our editor

15
01:09.330 --> 01:11.240
open index.blade.php

16
01:15.920 --> 01:24.480
and jump to `card-header` and here we'll place the heading on the left and the button on the right

17
01:24.480 --> 01:30.930
In the prior version of bootstrap we can utilize `pull-left` class to place element on the left and `pull-right` class to place

18
01:30.930 --> 01:31.940
element on the right.

19
01:31.980 --> 01:34.800
but now in bootstrap 4 we can utilize flexbox

20
01:47.550 --> 01:58.870
so div class `d-flex` and then to make the content of both sides in the same base line

21
01:58.870 --> 02:01.420
here we can add: align

22
02:03.950 --> 02:05.540
items center

23
02:08.160 --> 02:08.590
like so

24
02:15.980 --> 02:22.420
let's move this to here and we'll place it in heading two

25
02:29.160 --> 02:40.480
and then add a new div with class `ml-auto` or margin left auto so that the button inside it

26
02:40.830 --> 02:42.120
will be positioned in the right

27
02:47.230 --> 02:50.120
and here

28
02:50.150 --> 02:59.280
Let's add an anchor the target or href attribute will be

29
03:04.500 --> 03:11.740
route questions.create

30
03:12.070 --> 03:14.380
If you're not sure which route you will use

31
03:14.620 --> 03:24.220
Just go to your terminal and type php artisan route:list

32
03:28.900 --> 03:38.140
and you can also filter the routes by specify name tag equals and then the name

33
03:38.140 --> 03:40.090
In this case questions

34
03:43.450 --> 03:50.140
here you can see all routes for the questions and here question create

35
03:52.930 --> 04:01.560
will be mapped to questions control at create action.

36
04:03.400 --> 04:07.750
OK let's give it classes

37
04:10.150 --> 04:17.360
btn btn-outline-secondary

38
04:22.510 --> 04:25.930
and the next will be ask question

39
04:29.440 --> 04:32.580
save the changes and let's see

40
04:40.050 --> 04:46.500
All right here we have all questions heading on the left and the button on the right side.

41
04:46.860 --> 04:53.400
And if you see they are in the same baseline.

42
04:53.670 --> 05:01.700
Now if you click on the button we'll get a blank page because the create method in our questions controller is

43
05:01.700 --> 05:03.360
currently empty.

44
05:03.590 --> 05:06.040
Alright back to our editor

45
05:07.640 --> 05:11.610
and open questions control

46
05:16.460 --> 05:17.700
jump to create method

47
05:23.300 --> 05:23.730
here

48
05:23.760 --> 05:27.570
let's define a variable to hold empty question object

49
05:27.900 --> 05:39.800
So question equals new question and then return a view

50
05:44.220 --> 05:53.520
questions create and pass the question object to this view using compact

51
05:56.820 --> 05:57.890
question

52
06:01.580 --> 06:04.150
Now let's switch to index.blade.php

53
06:04.160 --> 06:09.310
and save this as

54
06:11.870 --> 06:13.220
create

55
06:13.750 --> 06:17.850
blade php save

56
06:21.120 --> 06:23.260
here let's change the heading to

57
06:27.250 --> 06:30.650
ask question

58
06:33.500 --> 06:46.010
and here we'll need to change this "Ask Question" to let's say "Back to all questions"

59
06:48.830 --> 06:50.270
and change the route

60
06:50.280 --> 06:52.140
to questions

61
06:52.190 --> 06:53.350
dot index

62
07:02.820 --> 07:09.450
and here inside `card-body` let's get rid of all contents

63
07:19.640 --> 07:21.080
and for now let's just show

64
07:21.090 --> 07:24.750
a message "question form"

65
07:28.670 --> 07:30.220
save all changes

66
07:32.340 --> 07:39.650
And let's see how it look like.

67
07:39.760 --> 07:44.710
Here we have "Ask question" on the left and "back to all questions" button on the right.

68
07:45.660 --> 07:52.200
And here we have question form show up here.

69
07:52.520 --> 07:52.990
OK

70
07:53.040 --> 07:55.860
Now let's change this text with actual form

71
08:01.050 --> 08:02.860
here let's get rid of this line

72
08:06.610 --> 08:07.800
and define a form

73
08:07.970 --> 08:12.820
So form action

74
08:16.370 --> 08:23.800
and it will be route questions dot store

75
08:26.530 --> 08:34.700
and then specify method attribute and it will be post in this case

76
08:44.580 --> 08:45.620
inside this form

77
08:45.630 --> 08:46.530
let's add a div

78
08:49.510 --> 08:56.390
and give it bootstrap class `form-group`

79
09:03.550 --> 09:05.450
Inside this we'll need a label

80
09:08.810 --> 09:12.050
for question title

81
09:14.870 --> 09:17.850
and then the label's text will be

82
09:17.930 --> 09:20.580
Question title.

83
09:22.880 --> 09:34.310
And we also need text input so input type text the name will be title

84
09:37.340 --> 09:44.420
and then the ID will be a question title

85
09:45.200 --> 09:55.930
And the class will be bootstrap form control

86
09:57.440 --> 09:58.810
OK let's duplicate these

87
10:10.480 --> 10:16.810
change the question title to question buddy.

88
10:17.140 --> 10:24.430
Actually this for and id attributes aren't necessary in this case by defining them

89
10:24.430 --> 10:26.650
is more semantic I think.

90
10:26.800 --> 10:37.060
And then here change that text to "explain your question"

91
10:39.850 --> 10:44.720
here for the question body we need a text area instead of text input.

92
10:45.160 --> 10:51.140
So let's remove this and add text area

93
10:54.500 --> 10:57.580
the name will be body

94
10:58.830 --> 11:05.350
The ID will be question-body let's set row attribute

95
11:08.990 --> 11:24.730
let's say 10 rows and the class will be form control.

96
11:24.780 --> 11:28.060
I think we only need this inputs at least for now

97
11:28.190 --> 11:31.070
and we'll need a button to submit our question.

98
11:31.220 --> 11:40.240
So let's add another form group.

99
11:44.870 --> 11:46.410
and in here let's add a button

100
11:49.640 --> 12:06.500
specify the type as submit and then give it classes btn btn-ounline-primary and make it a little

101
12:06.500 --> 12:09.330
bigger

102
12:09.340 --> 12:12.200
by specify btn-lg class

103
12:15.290 --> 12:17.150
and then the text will be

104
12:17.240 --> 12:21.090
let's say ask this question

105
12:26.600 --> 12:41.310
OK save all this and let's see.

106
12:41.530 --> 12:43.150
This should be `rows` I think

107
12:43.200 --> 12:48.770
Save reload again OK great.
