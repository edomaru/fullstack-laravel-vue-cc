00:01.830 --> 00:02.630
In the last lesson

1
00:02.700 --> 00:06.080
we have successfully added new feature to our application

2
00:06.310 --> 00:07.910
that allows us to create new question

3
00:08.010 --> 00:09.770
We've learned how to build a form

4
00:09.900 --> 00:13.630
we've learn how to implement form validation to validate the question

5
00:13.680 --> 00:18.170
and we've also learn how to save the valid question into our database.

6
00:18.210 --> 00:23.400
Now in this lesson we'll continue building our project and extending the functionality of the question

7
00:23.400 --> 00:28.070
form so that we can also update any existing questions.

8
00:28.080 --> 00:29.180
All right as always.

9
00:29.230 --> 00:32.110
let's isolate our work to a new branch.

10
00:32.370 --> 00:34.650
So let's go ahead and open our terminal

11
00:38.230 --> 00:40.060
And here we can say git

12
00:40.160 --> 00:44.790
checkout -b and the brand name

13
00:44.870 --> 00:46.510
Lesson 9

14
00:52.080 --> 00:52.490
OK

15
00:52.510 --> 00:59.800
firstly we need to add edit link on the question item. And here I think it would be better to place it on

16
00:59.800 --> 01:00.910
the right side

17
01:02.140 --> 01:09.040
of the question title this almost the same thing as we did here.

18
01:09.100 --> 01:10.930
So let's head over to our editor

19
01:14.610 --> 01:17.470
open index.blade.php

20
01:20.520 --> 01:31.220
and jump to media body.

21
01:32.200 --> 01:34.000
And then here let's define a new div

22
01:40.270 --> 01:48.250
and give it two classes d-flex align items

23
01:48.270 --> 01:48.930
center

24
01:56.770 --> 02:01.440
let's move the question title here.

25
02:09.610 --> 02:11.890
And here we'll place the link on the right site.

26
02:11.940 --> 02:13.550
So let's define another div

27
02:17.590 --> 02:24.590
and give it a class ml-auto or margin left

28
02:24.590 --> 02:25.010
auto

29
02:30.770 --> 02:33.300
and inside this div, let's define an anchor

30
02:36.410 --> 02:39.960
the href will be

31
02:45.330 --> 02:49.020
route question

32
02:51.400 --> 02:55.480
edit and then pass in the question Id

33
03:06.030 --> 03:07.360
give it some classes

34
03:08.700 --> 03:21.080
`btn` and than `btn-sm` to make it a little smaller then `btn-outline-info`.

35
03:26.240 --> 03:27.930
And the text will be edit

36
03:32.230 --> 03:39.510
save that and reload to page.

37
03:39.530 --> 03:44.580
Now here we have the edit button appear on each question

38
03:48.420 --> 03:55.050
Actually, this shouldn't be happened. Because, that means everyone that has signed in can modify any questions

39
03:55.490 --> 03:57.060
that belonging by anyone else

40
03:57.060 --> 04:03.650
right? For now we'll leave this issue, and in the future lesson we'll fix that by implementing authorization

41
04:03.650 --> 04:12.850
to every single question, so that only the owner of the question that able to modify.

42
04:13.000 --> 04:20.640
All right now if we click this of course we all got a blank page.

43
04:20.690 --> 04:22.580
So let's go back to our editor

44
04:25.870 --> 04:27.420
open questions controller

45
04:32.540 --> 04:35.370
an go to edit method

46
04:42.490 --> 04:48.850
Here if we notice in the url we pass id of the Question

47
04:49.180 --> 04:56.190
But here in the `edit` method, it's type-hinted to Question model.

48
04:56.200 --> 05:01.810
So, by doing this, Laravel will automatically inject the Question model instance that has an ID

49
05:01.810 --> 05:05.700
matching the corresponding value from the request uri.

50
05:06.100 --> 05:11.980
But if it's not found in the database then it will return 404 error.

51
05:12.040 --> 05:18.260
So it's similar with this

52
05:18.310 --> 05:19.580
edit id

53
05:21.100 --> 05:24.780
And then here we'll we find the question by id like this

54
05:40.250 --> 05:53.160
But here we simplify that by type-hint the parameter with Question model

55
05:53.180 --> 05:56.840
So here we can return view

56
05:59.760 --> 06:01.610
questions dot

57
06:02.130 --> 06:05.400
edit and then we pass in the question object

58
06:14.600 --> 06:17.990
OK here we return questions.edits view

59
06:18.140 --> 06:30.140
so let's create that file. Actually let's open questions create.blade.php and latter we will duplicate this file

60
06:30.530 --> 06:33.440
and we'll save it as edit.blade.php

61
06:33.530 --> 06:39.470
But before we do that we need to put the form inputs as well as the submit button into separate file

62
06:39.830 --> 06:46.970
or partial file because when we create new question or edit the question we will be have the same form

63
06:46.970 --> 06:58.610
elements but the differences could be in title, text of the button, form action and method.

64
06:58.660 --> 07:02.140
So let's collapse all from groups

65
07:11.320 --> 07:12.680
actually we'll

66
07:12.910 --> 07:13.680
also need to move

67
07:13.720 --> 07:18.760
The cscf blade directive so select these cut

68
07:24.740 --> 07:26.430
and inside questions

69
07:26.430 --> 07:28.800
folder let's create new file

70
07:33.030 --> 07:40.910
_form.blade.php again the underscore in the front of the file name is not necessary but

71
07:41.030 --> 07:50.760
it just to indicate that the file is partial file and it needs to be included in other view. OK here

72
07:50.870 --> 07:52.210
Just paste them in

73
08:00.930 --> 08:04.890
and since this file will be shared to create an edit file

74
08:04.890 --> 08:08.220
that's why we'll need to make the submit button's text dynamic.

75
08:08.430 --> 08:09.060
So

76
08:11.840 --> 08:12.910
let's change this

77
08:16.430 --> 08:16.930
to

78
08:19.920 --> 08:22.970
button text

79
08:25.800 --> 08:29.170
now in that create.blade.php

80
08:29.490 --> 08:36.510
We can call the _form.blade.php file by saying at include

81
08:40.120 --> 08:46.930
questions dot underscore form. In here

82
08:46.980 --> 08:54.240
we can also pass in the data to this partial view by specifying it in the second parameter.

83
08:54.990 --> 09:10.440
So in this case we'll pass array contains buttonText as a key and then the value will be ask question

84
09:15.100 --> 09:15.880
OK

85
09:16.160 --> 09:16.940
Save all these

86
09:21.930 --> 09:23.920
and let's see if everything is still working

87
09:27.360 --> 09:28.870
back to all questions

88
09:32.810 --> 09:34.980
And click ask questions button

89
09:39.280 --> 09:39.850
Alright

90
09:39.850 --> 09:40.990
It's working as it was.
