00:02.730 --> 00:08.640
Now it's time to make the component working 
as before let's switch back over to our editor

1
00:12.670 --> 00:14.010
before we moving on here

2
00:14.020 --> 00:19.420
I want to change how passing the name into 
vote component because it never change

3
00:19.510 --> 00:22.480
so we don't need the dynamic binding just like so

4
00:26.280 --> 00:26.850
let me see.

5
00:34.380 --> 00:38.390
OK we have the same thing.

6
00:39.120 --> 00:50.490
Let's also make changes in _answer.blade.php. Remove 
the quote and colon because again answer should

7
00:50.490 --> 00:51.960
be static and never change

8
00:51.960 --> 00:56.960
in all answers.

9
00:56.980 --> 01:00.090
All right let's switch to vote dot vue

10
01:03.820 --> 01:04.870
jump to template

11
01:09.960 --> 01:17.640
here in vote up button let's add v-on click prevent

12
01:20.560 --> 01:24.430
and call vote up method.

13
01:24.510 --> 01:28.030
Let's copy these

14
01:28.150 --> 01:37.010
And then in the vote down button we can paste 
the code and change the method to vote down.

15
01:37.060 --> 01:37.640
All right

16
01:37.720 --> 01:42.780
now let's define both vote up and vote down method in our script.

17
01:43.170 --> 01:45.660
But before that let me see the route

18
02:10.760 --> 02:11.240
OK

19
02:11.250 --> 02:12.900
here we have three uri patterns

20
02:13.950 --> 02:14.800
answers

21
02:14.920 --> 02:19.020
answer vote questions question vote.

22
02:19.230 --> 02:21.740
So we have to define dynamic endpoint in this case.

23
02:23.720 --> 02:24.950
And let me copy one of those

24
02:41.920 --> 02:55.390
here I'll define id property to store answer id or question Id.

25
02:55.650 --> 03:01.350
And then here in computed property let's define endpoint method

26
03:05.790 --> 03:08.040
and here we simply say return back tick

27
03:11.960 --> 03:15.600
forward slash and I'll paste the uri pattern.

28
03:21.160 --> 03:24.970
Here the second segment will be model id

29
03:30.260 --> 03:37.060
and first segment will be questions or answers 
both in plural. How can we handle this stuff?

30
03:38.900 --> 03:50.200
The simple solution is to leave the `s` on the end 
and change the singular name with this dot name

31
03:53.500 --> 03:57.570
so when enter the name with `question`

32
03:57.590 --> 04:05.510
this will be `questions` and when we enter the name 
with `answer` this first segment will be `answers`.

33
04:05.510 --> 04:06.060
All right

34
04:06.290 --> 04:08.090
Let's go to methods property

35
04:16.790 --> 04:20.650
and here let's define vote up method.

36
04:24.280 --> 04:27.980
Now the logic will be the same with vote down

37
04:28.470 --> 04:32.950
so here we'll call another method let's say

38
04:33.010 --> 04:33.870
underscore vote

39
04:35.760 --> 04:38.010
and pass in positive one

40
04:41.180 --> 04:43.720
then let's define vote down method

41
04:49.460 --> 04:59.350
and then call underscore vote and pass in negative one.

42
04:59.420 --> 05:01.760
And now let's defend the underscore vote method

43
05:05.170 --> 05:13.270
it should be has an argument here I'm going to call it vote.

44
05:13.450 --> 05:17.190
Here we will send ajax post request by saying axios

45
05:20.340 --> 05:24.200
post specify the request endpoint

46
05:29.160 --> 05:34.230
and pass in the request payload.

47
05:34.250 --> 05:42.570
So if you open vote answers controller here we need the vote

48
05:47.310 --> 05:56.600
so here vote colon vote or you can use object 
literal property value shorthand like this.

49
06:16.470 --> 06:19.120
And then after the ajax requests successfully sent

50
06:19.290 --> 06:20.520
let's show a flash message

51
06:34.510 --> 06:48.290
and I'll put the flash message on the bottom left.

52
06:48.300 --> 06:50.280
We also need to change the votes count

53
06:53.900 --> 07:01.020
for now let's add the count with vote.

54
07:01.070 --> 07:03.020
So this is a temporary solution.

55
07:03.020 --> 07:06.630
Later we'll come back here and fix this. Alright

56
07:06.650 --> 07:08.810
let's open vote answer controller. And

57
07:16.270 --> 07:16.560
here

58
07:16.580 --> 07:17.700
let's return message

59
07:17.770 --> 07:18.770
in json response

60
07:32.500 --> 07:40.180
message and here I'll say "thanks for the feedback"

61
07:44.690 --> 07:46.170
OK let's save all changes

62
07:48.970 --> 07:52.610
and let's see reload the page.

63
07:57.290 --> 08:00.450
Let me open console to see whether I find error or not.

64
08:03.270 --> 08:03.690
OK

65
08:03.710 --> 08:04.430
There was no error

66
08:09.940 --> 08:10.180
here

67
08:10.180 --> 08:11.380
I'm going to hit the vote up

68
08:14.680 --> 08:14.950
OK

69
08:14.950 --> 08:23.410
The number increasing and the 
success flossed messages show up.

70
08:23.520 --> 08:25.200
Now I'm going to hit the vote down.

71
08:27.270 --> 08:32.090
The number decreasing and the flash message show up.

72
08:32.350 --> 08:36.090
Now if I tried to hit the vote up or a vote down continuously

73
08:40.900 --> 08:46.360
the number will be increasing or decreasing.

74
08:46.370 --> 08:47.360
So let's fix this.
