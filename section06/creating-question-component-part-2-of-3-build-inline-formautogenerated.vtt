00:02.240 --> 00:08.240
The next thing that you need to do is adding functionality 
that allows us to easily modify our question

1
00:08.690 --> 00:16.040
so that we can edit or remove the question without 
need to go to questions page. To do that here we'll

2
00:16.050 --> 00:22.130
need to add edit and delete button like we have in answer here.

3
00:22.500 --> 00:24.580
So let's switch back over to our editor

4
00:28.090 --> 00:30.000
and open answer dot vue

5
00:38.550 --> 00:47.740
here let's copy these buttons switch to question dot vue.

6
00:47.910 --> 00:52.380
And then let's paste the buttons inside this first col four

7
01:04.490 --> 01:06.970
here we can simply replace the answer

8
01:07.100 --> 01:08.270
in authorize function to

9
01:12.540 --> 01:16.910
question. Next

10
01:17.070 --> 01:23.770
let's add a form inside the component.

11
01:23.850 --> 01:29.490
The question form that we will build is a bit different 
with the answer form. Here we will need a text

12
01:29.490 --> 01:35.630
box to edit the question title and a 
text area to edit the question body.

13
01:35.710 --> 01:45.050
That's why the form will be outside this card body.

14
01:45.110 --> 01:54.400
So let's duplicate this card body

15
01:54.490 --> 01:59.550
The first one is for our question form 
and it should be visible if editing

16
02:10.710 --> 02:14.370
then let's change this element to the form

17
02:24.230 --> 02:26.820
and then the second one should be invisible

18
02:26.930 --> 02:27.530
if editing.

19
02:37.630 --> 02:41.410
OK here in card title let's remove everything

20
02:47.130 --> 02:56.610
and then add a text input.

21
02:56.660 --> 03:00.870
Let's add bootstrap class form control

22
03:04.270 --> 03:07.780
and also add form control lg

23
03:11.390 --> 03:12.520
to make it more bigger.

24
03:16.810 --> 03:20.630
And then bind this input to question title via v-model

25
03:33.750 --> 03:34.120
here

26
03:34.130 --> 03:36.070
I think we don't need to show the vote

27
03:36.320 --> 03:37.440
so let's remove it.

28
03:47.540 --> 04:01.760
For the text area and buttons let's 
simply copy from answer component

29
04:01.820 --> 04:02.600
Let's copy

30
04:12.570 --> 04:13.640
and paste here.

31
04:22.720 --> 04:24.750
Let's also copy this event handler

32
04:30.370 --> 04:38.420
and paste in this form.

33
04:38.430 --> 04:39.690
Now we can jump to our script

34
04:44.800 --> 04:46.990
and then here in data method

35
04:49.980 --> 04:51.360
let's define editing properly

36
04:54.500 --> 04:55.810
and it make it false by default

37
04:59.420 --> 05:03.470
then let's also define id to store the question id

38
05:11.470 --> 05:16.360
and then we also need a property that 
will hold the question before modified.

39
05:16.570 --> 05:19.100
And here I'm going to call it before edit cache

40
05:22.980 --> 05:28.470
and it should be an empty object because letter 
will hold title and body of the question here.

41
05:34.780 --> 05:35.400
Next let's add

42
05:35.490 --> 05:36.630
computed property

43
05:40.720 --> 05:45.260
and inside here let's define is invalid method.

44
05:49.730 --> 05:52.910
Here let's do almost the same thing as we did before

45
05:53.050 --> 06:02.200
return this dot body dot length less than ten.

46
06:02.410 --> 06:13.930
And then let's add another condition or 
this dot title dot length is less than ten

47
06:20.610 --> 06:27.360
and then here I'll also define endpoint method.

48
06:27.570 --> 06:31.960
This will return the URI for update question.

49
06:42.600 --> 06:47.100
OK next let's add methods property

50
06:52.340 --> 06:53.790
and define edit method.

51
06:56.470 --> 07:00.520
Here before editing let's store the 
old question in before edit cache

52
07:20.540 --> 07:29.860
and then change the editing state to true.

53
07:30.030 --> 07:32.300
Then let's define cancel method

54
07:39.230 --> 07:40.440
and before cancelling

55
07:40.580 --> 07:43.100
let's restore the old question title and body

56
07:43.100 --> 07:43.880
respectfully.

57
08:00.190 --> 08:03.070
And then change the state of the editing to false

58
08:10.460 --> 08:13.000
and last let's define the update method.

59
08:16.470 --> 08:26.460
In this method will make ajax  call by saying axios dot 
put. We use put instead of patch because we'll need to

60
08:26.600 --> 08:28.820
update the title and body of the question

61
08:37.810 --> 08:48.830
so body from this body and then title from this title.

62
08:54.100 --> 08:56.860
Just in case or client side validation is not working

63
08:57.410 --> 09:00.790
let's show the server side validation 
error message in flash message

64
09:30.420 --> 09:31.540
and then when succeed

65
09:37.390 --> 09:56.090
we need to replace the local body html with 
body html that come from ajax response.

66
09:56.150 --> 09:58.510
Then let's also show success flash message

67
10:14.340 --> 10:26.590
and then change the editing states to 
false so that the form will be invisible.

68
10:26.600 --> 10:30.830
Now we need to make the ajax response to contain this

69
10:30.860 --> 10:35.210
body html and message.

70
10:35.240 --> 10:38.810
So let's open up questions controller

71
10:44.300 --> 10:45.560
go to update method

72
10:52.270 --> 10:54.690
And here let's provide json response

73
10:54.730 --> 10:56.650
if the request expects to be json

74
11:12.490 --> 11:13.230
add a message

75
11:16.220 --> 11:18.840
and again let's copy the message from here

76
11:27.350 --> 11:29.580
and then body underscore html

77
11:33.880 --> 11:41.780
and the value is from question body underscore html.

78
11:42.780 --> 11:44.550
All right let's save all

79
11:44.640 --> 11:44.940
changes

80
11:48.420 --> 11:49.770
and give it a try.

81
11:52.890 --> 11:53.720
Reload the page.

82
12:01.750 --> 12:02.770
Oops I get error

83
12:08.700 --> 12:11.120
destroy it's not defined on the instance

84
12:12.260 --> 12:15.010
Well I forgot to define the destroy method.

85
12:15.110 --> 12:22.940
So let's switch back over to our editor. 
Actually let's switch to answer dot vue

86
12:25.580 --> 12:27.080
find the destroy method

87
12:34.600 --> 12:36.240
let's select the method definition

88
12:41.800 --> 12:46.070
and then copy back to question component

89
12:52.490 --> 13:04.280
and here let's paste the code.

90
13:04.430 --> 13:12.670
Now here when the question is removed we need to 
redirect the page to all questions page. So what we

91
13:12.670 --> 13:15.520
have to do is to show the flash message

92
13:36.180 --> 13:42.140
and here we need to set the time out to maybe 
two seconds so that we can see the flash message.

93
13:50.560 --> 13:58.090
And then after that we can redirect it to all questions 
page. Here let's utilize javascript set time

94
13:58.090 --> 13:58.300
out

95
14:01.430 --> 14:07.880
and set the time to three seconds so to the 
command will be executed after three seconds.

96
14:14.690 --> 14:24.000
And then here we can redirect to questions page 
by saying window dot location dot href equals forward

97
14:24.000 --> 14:28.550
slash questions.

98
14:28.580 --> 14:35.840
All right now we can switch back to questions 
controller. Jump to destroy method

99
14:42.430 --> 14:44.910
and here let's provide json response.

100
14:56.410 --> 14:59.020
Inside here we only need to return message

101
15:02.260 --> 15:04.140
and we can copy from here

102
15:17.180 --> 15:18.210
reload the page

103
15:24.420 --> 15:24.850
OK

104
15:24.930 --> 15:26.090
Now we have no error.

105
15:31.430 --> 15:36.800
Now before I try to edit and delete the 
question here I'll get to all questions page

106
15:43.880 --> 15:44.940
then I'll create new

107
15:44.960 --> 15:59.310
one.

108
15:59.550 --> 16:03.730
Now I can try the edit or remove functionality to this question.

109
16:06.760 --> 16:11.470
Firstly let's try to edit the question change something

110
16:16.240 --> 16:18.330
and then here I'll hit the cancel button

111
16:21.190 --> 16:24.920
let me see the question. OK

112
16:24.920 --> 16:27.310
the question has not change. Now

113
16:27.330 --> 16:29.010
I'll make change to this question again

114
16:35.200 --> 16:36.730
and now hit the update button.

115
16:41.600 --> 16:42.370
OK here

116
16:42.400 --> 16:44.040
the question has changed.

117
16:44.110 --> 16:52.190
Let me reload the page to make sure that the change 
is persistence. Here I get this error because the change

118
16:52.190 --> 16:53.970
has affected the question slug

119
16:54.200 --> 16:56.450
So here I need to go to all questions page.

120
16:59.370 --> 16:59.770
OK

121
16:59.780 --> 17:05.380
the changes is persistence.

122
17:05.430 --> 17:07.130
Now let's try to hit the delete button

123
17:10.720 --> 17:14.510
hit yes

124
17:14.680 --> 17:19.840
The flash message show up and then it will 
be redirect to all questions page. Great
