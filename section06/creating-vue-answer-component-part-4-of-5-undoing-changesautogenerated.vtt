Not let's fix the issue on cancel button.

1
00:05.910 --> 00:09.300
So if you hit the edit button and then hit cancel button

2
00:12.650 --> 00:18.670
update request has been called and we get 
alert pop up and this is not what we expect.

3
00:19.580 --> 00:29.490
So let's switch back over to our editor and then 
open _answer.blade.php find the cancel button

4
00:32.800 --> 00:41.720
and here we can simply add type equal button because if you place any button in the form without specifying

5
00:41.720 --> 00:43.920
the type it will act like submit button.

6
00:45.730 --> 00:47.650
And here we don't need this anymore

7
00:51.000 --> 00:52.710
because we have handled that in the form.

8
00:56.240 --> 01:00.290
and let's also add to both of these buttons `btn` bootstrap class. Let's save

9
01:20.080 --> 01:21.450
and give it another try.

10
01:27.350 --> 01:28.270
Edit an answer

11
01:31.220 --> 01:33.900
and hit cancel button.

12
01:34.080 --> 01:35.170
All right

13
01:35.220 --> 01:37.650
Now no ajax call being sent and no alert

14
01:37.750 --> 01:40.700
Pop up.

15
01:40.870 --> 01:45.730
Now what if we hit this edit button and then add something here.

16
01:45.920 --> 01:56.280
Or let's look delet everything here and then hit 
cancel button. Now if edit the answer again.

17
01:56.390 --> 02:00.300
Here it's empty the changes is not persistence.

18
02:00.400 --> 02:01.950
So if we reload the page

19
02:07.030 --> 02:08.500
the answer is still there.

20
02:08.650 --> 02:11.860
I think this is another a big deal but it's look weird.

21
02:12.190 --> 02:17.190
So to fix this issue let's switch over to answer dot vue

22
02:20.780 --> 02:23.110
here in data method

23
02:23.150 --> 02:26.930
let's add another property that will 
hold the answer body before editing.

24
02:29.660 --> 02:29.970
Here

25
02:29.980 --> 02:32.190
I'm going to call it before edit cache

26
02:35.650 --> 02:36.730
and is null by default

27
02:40.200 --> 02:41.950
and then here in methods property

28
02:47.060 --> 02:48.570
let's add two methods.

29
02:48.800 --> 02:50.060
The first one is edit

30
02:56.080 --> 02:56.670
in here

31
02:56.740 --> 03:01.090
before editing we store the old answer 
body to `beforeEditCache` property

32
03:09.150 --> 03:11.490
and then we change the editing property to true.

33
03:19.310 --> 03:21.280
the second method is cancel

34
03:24.870 --> 03:30.130
when canceling or undoing the change we 
simply restore the body property with old body

35
03:30.180 --> 03:32.010
that stored in `beforeEditCache`.

36
03:40.130 --> 03:48.940
and after that we can change the editing state to false.

37
03:49.120 --> 03:49.450
All right

38
03:49.450 --> 03:52.110
we can switch to _answer.blade.php

39
03:56.330 --> 03:58.260
and then change the on click of this edit button

40
04:01.550 --> 04:03.370
to call edit method

41
04:07.350 --> 04:09.280
and then we also need to change this

42
04:13.580 --> 04:19.880
to call cancel method.

43
04:20.110 --> 04:25.150
Let's save all these and give a try one more time.

44
04:32.650 --> 04:37.290
Edit an answer change something here

45
04:39.000 --> 04:42.480
and then hit cancel button.

46
04:42.590 --> 04:42.850
Now

47
04:42.850 --> 04:44.290
If you hit the edit button again

48
04:47.070 --> 04:48.690
the answer is not change.

49
04:48.780 --> 04:49.680
Great.

50
04:51.930 --> 04:52.420
Next

51
04:52.470 --> 04:57.860
let's see another issue if we reload the page.

52
04:58.050 --> 05:01.440
We can see the form for a fraction of a second.

53
05:01.560 --> 05:02.840
So the fix this.

54
05:02.910 --> 05:04.590
Let's switch over to our editor

55
05:08.970 --> 05:11.800
and open answers underscore index

56
05:11.800 --> 05:12.560
blade php

57
05:18.860 --> 05:22.290
and inside this div we can add

58
05:25.160 --> 05:34.410
v-cloak like so. This directive will remain on the element 
until the associated vue instance finished compilation.

59
05:34.590 --> 05:40.900
As soon as vue instance ready this directive is removed.

60
05:40.930 --> 05:43.220
Now we can open app.scss

61
05:47.750 --> 05:52.170
a define new css rule like so v-cloak

62
05:56.360 --> 05:57.170
display

63
05:57.290 --> 06:02.070
none.

64
06:02.150 --> 06:06.270
So any elements which contains v-clock attribute will be hidden.

65
06:07.860 --> 06:09.320
Le's save all changes

66
06:11.120 --> 06:12.060
and have a look.

67
06:25.900 --> 06:32.200
As you can see now then the  page firstly loaded we 
cannot see any answers but after a fraction of a second

68
06:32.350 --> 06:33.810
will answer displayed

69
06:34.360 --> 06:35.410
and I think it's much better.
