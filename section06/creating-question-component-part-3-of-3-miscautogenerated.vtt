00:02.670 --> 00:04.590
Now if we see our other question

1
00:11.230 --> 00:17.710
here it has four answers but the delete button is still active.

2
00:18.140 --> 00:23.820
If we try to delete the question I'm sure it will be failed 
because we have protected to be removed in the

3
00:23.960 --> 00:35.440
server side by utilizing laravel policy. So let's switch 
back over to our editor and then open question policy

4
00:40.150 --> 00:42.770
here we authorize the question can be deleted if

5
00:42.770 --> 00:45.640
the question is by owned by the current user

6
00:46.130 --> 00:47.370
and it has no answer.

7
00:49.150 --> 00:54.950
So here we need to rewrite this logic in our javascript code. Let's

8
00:56.530 --> 01:05.520
open up authorization policies dot js

9
01:05.720 --> 01:08.660
And then here let's create another method. Here

10
01:08.660 --> 01:10.600
I'm going to call it delete question

11
01:15.070 --> 01:23.820
the first argument is user and the second argument is question.

12
01:24.060 --> 01:28.860
Here we simply match id of the user with user id of the question.

13
01:36.620 --> 01:42.780
And we also check if question answers count is less than one.

14
01:42.840 --> 01:45.880
OK now we can switch back to question component.

15
01:57.170 --> 02:07.770
And change the first argument of the 
authorize function to be delete question.

16
02:07.820 --> 02:09.130
Let's save all changes.

17
02:16.600 --> 02:17.660
reload the page

18
02:23.050 --> 02:23.650
OK

19
02:23.730 --> 02:25.290
Now the delete button disappear

20
02:25.430 --> 02:34.410
great.

21
02:34.440 --> 02:41.830
The last thing that we need to do before we end this lesson 
is to wrap both of these in another vue js component.

22
02:43.080 --> 02:47.350
Actually we can leave them like this and everything should be fine.

23
02:47.670 --> 02:53.550
But I think it would be much better to create one big 
component that will contain other components in

24
02:53.550 --> 02:56.620
a page.

25
02:56.670 --> 02:59.760
So let's cut everything inside this section content

26
03:03.270 --> 03:06.750
and then call another component that we will create shortly.

27
03:06.750 --> 03:09.730
Here we can say question page

28
03:12.580 --> 03:16.870
bind question to question instance

29
03:21.180 --> 03:26.200
and close the component. That's it.

30
03:26.260 --> 03:31.040
Now we can go to assets js folder.

31
03:34.110 --> 03:40.830
Here I will not place the new component inside this 
components because I want to show that this is a big

32
03:40.830 --> 03:41.680
component

33
03:41.880 --> 03:44.240
where other components house in it.

34
03:44.280 --> 03:46.960
It represents a single page.

35
03:47.020 --> 03:48.450
So here I'll create new folder

36
03:52.270 --> 03:57.540
and I'm going to call it pages. Inside this folder let's create

37
03:57.750 --> 04:03.150
new file and call it question page dot vue

38
04:08.720 --> 04:09.930
and then inside this file

39
04:15.250 --> 04:16.040
just paste the code

40
04:25.180 --> 04:27.910
and replace the blade syntax to vue js syntax

41
04:40.070 --> 04:42.050
and last let's add script section

42
04:49.150 --> 04:49.580
here

43
04:49.630 --> 04:53.420
let's register the question and answers component as local components

44
05:11.810 --> 05:12.230
here

45
05:12.250 --> 05:14.090
let's add components property

46
05:16.900 --> 05:18.340
and register them here.

47
05:26.240 --> 05:28.060
Now we can go to app.js

48
05:32.540 --> 05:42.940
and remove this components because now they 
registered as a local component inside question page.

49
05:43.030 --> 05:44.550
Don't forget to add props.

50
05:49.550 --> 05:56.230
And then specify question.

51
05:56.300 --> 05:56.820
All right

52
05:56.820 --> 06:02.330
let's save all changes

53
06:02.590 --> 06:05.140
and let's make sure that everything is working just fine.

54
06:08.490 --> 06:09.310
Reload the page

55
06:12.680 --> 06:16.720
something went wrong. Let me open console

56
06:19.100 --> 06:26.820
Here I have ever unknown custom element question 
page. I forgot to register this component in app dot

57
06:26.820 --> 06:27.210
js file

58
06:30.120 --> 06:34.670
so back to app.js

59
06:34.800 --> 06:35.780
I undo the change

60
06:39.590 --> 06:46.130
remove the last and change this to question

61
06:46.180 --> 06:49.120
page and it come from

62
06:51.980 --> 06:52.710
pages

63
06:56.460 --> 07:00.300
Question page dot vue. Here

64
07:00.300 --> 07:03.300
we can keep these components as a global component

65
07:04.900 --> 07:10.730
Or let's just remove them from here because I 
think they will be better as a local component.

66
07:13.400 --> 07:14.630
Now if I save these

67
07:19.170 --> 07:21.380
and reload the page. We will have another error

68
07:27.970 --> 07:35.280
actually we'll get a lot of errors. This because we 
need to register both components in question page

69
07:35.600 --> 07:45.590
I mean we need to register them in question component.

70
07:45.800 --> 07:46.370
So here

71
07:52.270 --> 07:54.280
import vote from vote dot

72
07:59.100 --> 08:13.310
vue. And then import user info from user info dot vue

73
08:16.060 --> 08:19.600
and then add them in components property.

74
08:38.560 --> 08:39.010
Reload again

75
08:43.190 --> 08:44.660
the errors still remain.

76
08:44.840 --> 08:53.030
But now I have six errors and to fix these we 
need to do the same thing in answer component.

77
08:54.190 --> 08:55.250
So let's copy these

78
08:58.470 --> 09:00.390
then go to answer dot vue

79
09:03.580 --> 09:04.100
paste

80
09:07.240 --> 09:09.490
let's also copy components property

81
09:14.390 --> 09:16.850
and then paste here. Save

82
09:21.240 --> 09:21.840
reload again

83
09:26.130 --> 09:26.500
OK

84
09:26.520 --> 09:27.720
now we have no errors

85
09:33.770 --> 09:35.490
and everything working just fine.

86
09:37.010 --> 09:39.220
Now if I open vue developer tools

87
09:41.900 --> 09:48.710
as you can see here now below root component we'll 
have question page component that contains question

88
09:49.460 --> 09:50.470
and answers component

89
09:56.670 --> 09:57.090
OK

90
09:57.100 --> 10:02.710
we have successfully rewritten the entire parts of this 
show question page into vue js components and

91
10:02.710 --> 10:05.630
it's make our application now look more interactive.

92
10:06.700 --> 10:10.470
All right before we end this section there 
is one thing that we need to do here.

93
10:14.710 --> 10:16.450
If you see the answer component

94
10:19.280 --> 10:20.540
and question component

95
10:23.740 --> 10:25.440
we have some duplicate code.

96
10:25.780 --> 10:31.870
So in the next lesson we'll refactor our code in 
our components and implement DRY principle.

97
10:32.440 --> 10:32.790
OK

98
10:32.830 --> 10:36.470
Let's save all changes into our git 
repo and join me in the next lesson.
