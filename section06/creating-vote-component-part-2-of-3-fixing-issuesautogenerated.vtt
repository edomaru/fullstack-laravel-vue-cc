00:03.170 --> 00:07.820
Let's switch back over to our code 
editor. Switch to vote component

1
00:10.620 --> 00:15.510
here in then method instead of adding the count with vote value

2
00:15.870 --> 00:22.090
let's change it by reassign the vote count from json response.

3
00:22.180 --> 00:24.570
Here we have not defined yet the votes count

4
00:24.760 --> 00:26.890
in our json response.

5
00:27.090 --> 00:30.400
So let's switch to vote answer controller

6
00:35.140 --> 00:35.830
and here

7
00:36.040 --> 00:38.040
when we call vote answer method

8
00:38.500 --> 00:44.050
let's return the actual vote answer. So let's assign into a variable

9
00:46.670 --> 00:48.770
let's say votes count

10
00:54.870 --> 00:57.510
and then returned the votes count in the json response.

11
01:04.520 --> 01:08.280
Now let's modify the vote answer method in the user model

12
01:08.440 --> 01:13.660
to turn the actual vote answer.

13
01:13.820 --> 01:15.300
Le'ts open the user model

14
01:18.740 --> 01:21.720
and find the vote answer method

15
01:30.810 --> 01:37.850
here let's add return in the front of 
this underscore vote method call.

16
01:38.070 --> 01:46.770
Le'ts do the same thing to vote question.

17
01:46.920 --> 02:04.220
And now here in underscore vote 
let's return the model's vote count

18
02:04.250 --> 02:05.810
All right let's save all changes.

19
02:10.370 --> 02:13.610
And let's give another try.

20
02:14.000 --> 02:15.320
Reload the page

21
02:23.150 --> 02:26.800
hit the vote up button.

22
02:27.040 --> 02:29.660
The number increasing.

23
02:29.820 --> 02:30.630
And then hit again

24
02:33.530 --> 02:37.650
the number still increasing.

25
02:37.660 --> 02:38.660
Let me see my code

26
02:42.730 --> 02:47.520
OK here we don't need this plus operator 
because we need to reassign the count

27
02:52.960 --> 02:53.960
reload again.

28
02:57.650 --> 02:58.520
Hit the vote up button

29
03:01.900 --> 03:03.460
nothing changed.

30
03:03.520 --> 03:04.960
Now if I hit the vote down

31
03:08.210 --> 03:15.370
the number decreasing I'll hit the vote up again the number increasing

32
03:18.050 --> 03:19.020
I'll hit again.

33
03:20.120 --> 03:21.190
Nothing change.

34
03:21.190 --> 03:23.550
Great.

35
03:23.550 --> 03:24.280
All right

36
03:24.360 --> 03:29.970
The last thing that we need to do is protecting this 
component so that only the authenticated user that

37
03:29.970 --> 03:32.780
can vote the answer or question.

38
03:33.450 --> 03:35.490
Let's switch back over to our editor

39
03:39.200 --> 03:52.080
And here in this method let's add if statement 
to check if the user has signed in.

40
03:52.330 --> 03:55.870
So if the user has not signed in let's show warning message

41
04:01.800 --> 04:07.620
and here I'm going to say "please login to vote the

42
04:10.250 --> 04:11.240
this dot name".

43
04:16.870 --> 04:18.310
the title will be warning

44
04:25.380 --> 04:27.510
set the time out to 30 seconds

45
04:30.940 --> 04:32.700
and position to bottom left

46
04:39.850 --> 04:47.410
and don't forget to add return so that the 
code outside if statement  will be executed.

47
04:47.470 --> 04:48.190
Let's save

48
04:53.480 --> 04:54.710
I'll copy the URL

49
04:59.470 --> 05:01.760
then I'll open incognito window.

50
05:06.330 --> 05:07.450
And pens they URL

51
05:18.520 --> 05:22.040
here we see that the icon's color in light gray.

52
05:22.430 --> 05:41.860
And if I hit the vote up or vote down 
button I'll get a warning message.

53
05:41.900 --> 05:42.260
All right

54
05:42.260 --> 05:48.080
We have successfully rewritten or a vote control from blade into vue js component. It is working just

55
05:48.080 --> 05:52.010
fine as before but now it's no need 
to reload the page to see the change

56
05:55.050 --> 05:55.480
OK

57
05:55.500 --> 05:56.400
That's it

58
05:56.400 --> 05:58.720
Le'ts coming our changes to our git repo.

59
05:58.830 --> 06:01.680
Then take a quick break and then join me in the next lesson.
