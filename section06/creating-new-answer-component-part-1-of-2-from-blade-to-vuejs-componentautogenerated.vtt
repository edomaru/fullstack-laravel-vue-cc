00:02.030 --> 00:07.640
In this lesson we are going to rewrite this answer form 
into vue js component so that new answer can

1
00:07.640 --> 00:13.610
be added without need to refresh the page. After we 
finished that we'll have complete components with

2
00:13.610 --> 00:17.180
a full set AJAX CRUD for our answers.

3
00:17.180 --> 00:17.680
All right

4
00:17.720 --> 00:24.330
let's open up our terminal and then create 
new branch to isolate our work today.

5
00:24.540 --> 00:32.670
git checkout -b lesson 40

6
00:32.900 --> 00:36.260
And then run web pack by saying npm run watch

7
00:42.110 --> 00:42.700
OK

8
00:42.840 --> 00:46.230
Let me open questions

9
00:46.600 --> 00:55.710
show blade php

10
00:55.940 --> 01:00.410
And here you can see our answer form included here in this file.

11
01:00.410 --> 01:06.800
Now when new answer created we need to push it to 
answers array which house in answers component so that

12
01:06.800 --> 01:14.840
it can reactively added in the UI. That means we need to 
place our new component or answer form inside the

13
01:14.840 --> 01:17.080
answers component.

14
01:18.410 --> 01:21.450
OK let's open up answers

15
01:24.630 --> 01:29.270
underscore create blade php here

16
01:29.300 --> 01:30.650
let's copy everything.

17
01:33.570 --> 01:37.620
Now let's go to assets js components.

18
01:40.920 --> 01:47.160
And here let's create new file and I'll call it new answer dot vue

19
01:50.800 --> 01:51.710
here let's add template

20
01:54.850 --> 02:05.750
and paste the markup.

21
02:06.010 --> 02:09.480
Let's remove the action and method attributge from the form

22
02:14.420 --> 02:19.720
and we don't need this csrf token because 
laravel has handled that in bootstrap dot

23
02:19.760 --> 02:20.520
js

24
02:24.700 --> 02:30.700
And then let's remove the validation stuff from this text 
area because we will implement simple client side

25
02:30.700 --> 02:31.750
validation

26
02:31.780 --> 02:32.810
So as we did before

27
02:44.870 --> 02:52.820
so here let's add html 5 required attribute

28
02:52.980 --> 02:57.070
And then let's bind the body of the question to this text area

29
02:57.090 --> 03:00.900
using two way data binding v-model

30
03:03.740 --> 03:14.950
body.

31
03:14.990 --> 03:18.540
Also let's disable this button if answer is invalid.

32
03:26.240 --> 03:29.090
All right let's define the component logic in the script tag

33
03:36.410 --> 03:37.230
add data method

34
03:40.030 --> 03:41.150
and then return object

35
03:44.570 --> 03:57.650
and it's contain body of the answer 
which should be empty default.

36
03:57.870 --> 04:00.220
And then let's define computed property

37
04:05.400 --> 04:07.570
And define the is invalid method

38
04:12.720 --> 04:16.170
here we simply check if the user not sign in

39
04:25.790 --> 04:32.970
or the length of the answer body that entered is less than 10.

40
04:33.060 --> 04:40.660
So this is invalid method will return true 
at least one of this condition is met

41
04:41.870 --> 04:42.260
OK

42
04:42.290 --> 04:48.830
Before we add more code in here let's register this component 
as a local component in the answers component.

43
04:49.550 --> 04:52.350
Let's open up answers dot vue

44
05:01.050 --> 05:21.760
and then import our new answer component by 
saying import new answer from new answer dot vue

45
05:21.940 --> 05:28.990
And then add it in this components property.

46
05:29.110 --> 05:34.360
Now in template we need to place the new 
answer component after our list answers

47
05:34.530 --> 05:42.270
outside this row div and because in a single file component

48
05:42.370 --> 05:46.010
it should be only one parent element so here

49
05:46.440 --> 05:47.420
let's add another div

50
05:57.000 --> 06:07.370
and move the row that contains all answers inside.

51
06:07.560 --> 06:10.220
And then add new answer component

52
06:19.670 --> 06:20.890
let's save all changes.

53
06:24.930 --> 06:26.940
And let's make sure we have no error

54
06:32.900 --> 06:39.880
reload the page.

55
06:40.150 --> 06:41.490
Let me open developer tool

56
06:48.800 --> 06:49.190
OK

57
06:49.200 --> 06:51.520
we have no error and I think it should be fine.

58
06:54.130 --> 06:56.550
Oh no I have two answer forms.

59
06:58.490 --> 07:00.200
I need to remove the last one

60
07:00.230 --> 07:05.450
that stay in show blade php

61
07:05.570 --> 07:08.090
Let me switch back over to my editor.

62
07:11.140 --> 07:18.680
And then I'll reopen show blade php and here I'll remove this line.

63
07:25.700 --> 07:26.640
Reload again

64
07:29.460 --> 07:37.130
now there's only one form and as 
you can see the button is inactive.

65
07:37.480 --> 07:40.540
If we answer something more than 10 characters

66
07:45.900 --> 07:48.190
the button become active immediately.

67
07:50.590 --> 07:50.900
OK

68
07:50.920 --> 07:52.510
Great.
