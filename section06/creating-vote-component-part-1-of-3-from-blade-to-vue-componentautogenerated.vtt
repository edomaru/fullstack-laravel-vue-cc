00:02.740 --> 00:08.860
After we have successfully rewritten our favorite and accept 
button into vue js component now we can continue

1
00:08.860 --> 00:15.440
building our project and rewrite our vote 
controls into vue js component. OK

2
00:15.460 --> 00:17.920
without further ado let's get started.

3
00:18.400 --> 00:20.170
Let's switch over to our terminal

4
00:22.210 --> 00:25.550
and then create new branch by saying git checkout

5
00:25.570 --> 00:31.730
-b lesson-35

6
00:32.230 --> 00:35.700
And then we can run web pack by saying npm

7
00:35.940 --> 00:40.160
run watch.

8
00:40.320 --> 00:45.570
Now let's open up shared _vote.blade.php

9
00:53.720 --> 00:54.720
let's copy the markup

10
00:59.330 --> 01:10.230
and then go to assets js components 
folder and then create new file.

11
01:10.320 --> 01:12.720
I'm going to call it vote.vue

12
01:16.530 --> 01:18.900
inside this file let's add template tag

13
01:23.130 --> 01:24.210
and paste the markup

14
01:35.600 --> 01:36.010
here

15
01:36.080 --> 01:48.740
let's remove this if else statement and 
then utilize the v-if and v-else directive.

16
01:48.770 --> 01:53.770
I don't have any idea how to check the 
instance of an object in Javascript.

17
01:53.930 --> 01:55.920
So here I'm going to check the name instead.

18
02:03.000 --> 02:09.340
If the name is question this favourite component will be shown

19
02:13.320 --> 02:14.190
otherwise

20
02:18.440 --> 02:20.200
Is the name is answer

21
02:22.890 --> 02:25.440
then this accept component will be shown.

22
02:25.690 --> 02:29.760
Or we can simplify this with v-else directive

23
02:34.700 --> 02:39.070
because we are no longer in blade file

24
02:39.120 --> 02:53.570
let's check the model from php variable into javascript.

25
02:53.620 --> 02:57.110
So in this component we need to define two properties

26
02:57.280 --> 03:01.960
name and model.

27
03:02.110 --> 03:06.110
Let's add script tag

28
03:06.300 --> 03:07.350
define props

29
03:11.540 --> 03:21.340
and add name and model.

30
03:21.360 --> 03:26.700
Now let's remove all on click attributes as well as the forms from this component

31
03:50.790 --> 03:51.270
and then

32
03:54.350 --> 03:57.460
remove the additional class and add class binding.

33
03:58.680 --> 04:07.860
This almost the same thing as we did in the previous 
lesson so when user not signed in we add `off` class.

34
04:26.110 --> 04:27.590
Let's define computed poperty

35
04:32.800 --> 04:35.050
and inside here let's define classes method

36
04:40.310 --> 04:46.640
here is simply return nothing if a user 
has signed in or off if user not signed in

37
04:52.590 --> 05:02.180
next let's make change to title attribute both in vote up 
and vote down button. Since the title should be dynamic

38
05:03.940 --> 05:04.690
so

39
05:07.810 --> 05:08.800
let's cut the text

40
05:12.700 --> 05:14.980
and remove the title's text here.

41
05:22.590 --> 05:26.550
And we will bind this title attribute to a method let's say title

42
05:32.520 --> 05:36.240
pass in up in vote up anchor

43
05:39.020 --> 05:40.550
and pass in down

44
05:41.490 --> 05:42.640
in vote down anchor

45
05:46.490 --> 05:47.610
here in script tag

46
05:51.390 --> 05:52.820
let's add methods property

47
05:59.110 --> 06:07.900
and inside here let's define the title method and of 
course this method should has an argument vote type

48
06:12.220 --> 06:12.940
here

49
06:12.940 --> 06:14.640
firstly let's provide titles

50
06:20.740 --> 06:24.440
each for vote up and vote down

51
06:33.860 --> 06:35.460
and make each name dynamic.

52
06:47.540 --> 06:52.920
And then we simply return the title based 
on the type that we enter in the argument.

53
06:58.960 --> 06:59.510
Next

54
06:59.590 --> 07:02.130
let's make change the vote count. Here

55
07:02.140 --> 07:06.440
I'm going to change this to count. Here in the script

56
07:09.510 --> 07:14.320
I'll define data method return an object

57
07:17.410 --> 07:18.520
and inside here

58
07:19.590 --> 07:28.990
I'll define count property to hold model dot votes count.

59
07:29.010 --> 07:32.690
Now let's register this vote component in app.js

60
07:39.620 --> 07:43.220
duplicate this line

61
07:43.310 --> 07:51.470
the component name will be vote and 
it come from components vote.vue

62
07:54.780 --> 07:55.810
Here

63
07:56.020 --> 08:02.790
this favourite and accept component will only called 
inside the vote component and they will not called

64
08:02.880 --> 08:04.190
in other places.

65
08:04.230 --> 08:12.990
So let's remove both of these from here and we will register 
them as local component inside the vote component.

66
08:13.350 --> 08:15.270
Let's go back to vote.vue

67
08:19.290 --> 08:19.700
here

68
08:19.710 --> 08:26.720
I'm going import the components using 
native es6 module like this import Favorite

69
08:29.590 --> 08:30.250
from

70
08:33.040 --> 08:34.760
because we are in the same directory

71
08:40.060 --> 08:43.530
here we can call the file path like this dot forward

72
08:43.540 --> 08:45.050
slash favorite dot vue

73
08:48.530 --> 08:49.930
Let's duplicate this line

74
08:53.450 --> 08:55.550
And change to accept

75
09:05.380 --> 09:05.950
Here

76
09:06.380 --> 09:08.400
let's define components property

77
09:14.130 --> 09:17.190
and register both favorite and accept component here.

78
09:22.180 --> 09:25.410
Here the key will be the name of our component.

79
09:25.540 --> 09:29.900
So it's equivalent with this one.

80
09:30.910 --> 09:38.000
But here we should define it in camel case 
and vue js  will interpret it in kebab case.

81
09:38.020 --> 09:39.730
So if we change these to

82
09:42.490 --> 09:43.470
favorite component

83
09:46.300 --> 09:51.800
then in our template we call favorite dash component.

84
10:00.920 --> 10:01.380
Next

85
10:01.490 --> 10:03.740
let's also register the accept component

86
10:11.750 --> 10:18.830
in es6 if we want to define an object which the key 
has the same name with a value then we can use

87
10:18.830 --> 10:24.190
the shorthand syntax by simply pass the key name just like this

88
10:27.270 --> 10:31.810
favorite accept.

89
10:31.910 --> 10:35.780
So this is called object literal property value shorthand.

90
10:36.160 --> 10:36.660
All right

91
10:36.680 --> 10:39.820
now let's call this component in _answer

92
10:39.860 --> 10:40.640
blade php

93
10:59.430 --> 11:04.940
here we can call our vote component by saying vote model

94
11:08.050 --> 11:08.670
answer

95
11:13.030 --> 11:13.420
name

96
11:17.730 --> 11:18.220
answer

97
11:25.550 --> 11:26.780
let's save all changes

98
11:32.420 --> 11:33.290
and have a look.

99
11:36.690 --> 11:43.190
Reload the page.

100
11:43.270 --> 11:44.290
It's look no difference

101
11:47.110 --> 11:48.400
Actually

102
11:48.520 --> 11:50.170
We lose our favorite button.

103
11:50.470 --> 11:54.420
Let me open my browser console. Here

104
11:54.460 --> 11:57.220
I have error unknown custom elements fovorite

105
11:57.220 --> 11:58.830
did you register the company correctly

106
11:58.840 --> 11:59.670
blah blah blah.

107
12:02.040 --> 12:08.880
I'm sure this error because we haven't changed in 
here the vote control with our new vote component.

108
12:09.120 --> 12:11.100
So let's switch back over to our editor

109
12:15.130 --> 12:18.080
open questions show blade php

110
12:25.990 --> 12:26.370
Here

111
12:26.420 --> 12:29.110
let's replace this with our vote component.

112
12:51.790 --> 12:57.220
now the favorite button come back and we have no error here.

113
13:02.660 --> 13:10.290
Here let me see the tool tips "this question 
is useful",  "this question is not useful"

114
13:10.600 --> 13:11.020
Now

115
13:11.090 --> 13:16.650
let me see the tool tips on the answer 
the tool tip "this answer is useful".

116
13:17.230 --> 13:19.470
And "this answer is not useful".

117
13:19.480 --> 13:19.990
Great.
