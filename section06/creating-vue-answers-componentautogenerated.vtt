00:02.570 --> 00:09.280
Right in the beginning of this section we've created 
answer component by utilizing vue js inline template.

1
00:09.480 --> 00:15.570
The reason why we use inline template is because we 
want to keep our markup that contains laravel authorization

2
00:15.570 --> 00:24.600
logic. Now since we have rewritten the authorization 
logic in javascript and because it's hard to implement

3
00:24.610 --> 00:30.850
the vue reactive system when adding new answer that's why 
here we come back to answer component and we'll make

4
00:30.850 --> 00:31.990
a lot of changes.

5
00:35.810 --> 00:45.230
All right let's open up our terminal and then create 
new branch by saying git checkout -b lesson

6
00:46.050 --> 00:46.970
36

7
00:50.490 --> 01:00.270
and then let's run web pack by saying npm run watch.

8
01:00.290 --> 01:05.960
So if you open up the questions show blade php file

9
01:12.860 --> 01:19.150
here we include another view file answers dot underscore index.

10
01:19.150 --> 01:23.980
And if we open up answers underscored index blade php

11
01:26.890 --> 01:34.030
here we loop all answers.

12
01:34.080 --> 01:40.990
So here we need to move everything 
inside this  file into answer dot vue file

13
01:41.260 --> 01:46.430
And then we do another component as parent 
component that will loop each answer component

14
01:49.160 --> 01:50.950
so let's selecting everything

15
01:51.110 --> 01:52.480
inside this answer tag

16
01:56.170 --> 01:59.060
copy go to answer dot vue add

17
02:03.520 --> 02:04.250
template tag

18
02:08.160 --> 02:09.060
and paste the markup

19
02:14.510 --> 02:21.940
here since we are in vue component let's replace the 
php variable in this model property to javascript

20
02:21.950 --> 02:32.970
variable.

21
02:33.080 --> 02:46.880
Let's also do the same thing in model 
property inside user info component.

22
02:47.080 --> 02:53.070
Then let's replace the laravel authorization checking 
on edit and delete button with our javascript

23
02:53.140 --> 02:57.000
authorization function.

24
02:57.210 --> 03:00.190
Let's get rid of the can directive from our buttons

25
03:16.550 --> 03:20.360
And here we simply say v-if authorize

26
03:23.500 --> 03:25.940
modify answer

27
03:29.250 --> 03:30.540
let's copy this code.

28
03:35.700 --> 03:36.660
And then paste it here

29
03:39.770 --> 03:41.120
all right I think

30
03:41.120 --> 03:43.450
that's all we need to do in this answer companion.

31
03:43.800 --> 03:50.450
The next thing that we need to do is loop this answer 
component in the parent component by utilizing

32
03:50.640 --> 03:51.840
vue js list rendering.

33
03:52.010 --> 03:59.790
But before that of course we need to create the parent component. So let's open answers _index.blade.php

34
03:59.880 --> 04:04.010
copy everything inside if statement

35
04:07.490 --> 04:19.690
Then go to assets js components and then create 
new file here I'm going to call it answers dot vue

36
04:21.590 --> 04:23.080
so answers in plural

37
04:26.710 --> 04:32.190
then add template tag and paste the markup inside

38
04:36.500 --> 04:38.910
we don't need this layouts messages anymore.

39
04:38.990 --> 04:40.260
So let's move it.

40
04:47.020 --> 04:50.820
And then let's replace this foreach loop with vue js list rendering

41
04:50.980 --> 04:54.080
or utilizing v-for directive in this case.

42
04:54.850 --> 05:01.890
So answer v-for answer

43
05:04.270 --> 05:05.250
in answers

44
05:08.030 --> 05:17.250
and we need to bind the answer property that are 
needed by this component with answer that come from

45
05:18.150 --> 05:18.850
here.

46
05:24.430 --> 05:26.620
And start from 2.2

47
05:26.810 --> 05:41.040
we need to provide a key when working with the v-for

48
05:41.230 --> 05:43.360
If you're using Visual Studio code like me

49
05:46.180 --> 05:48.190
you'll get errors if you don't provide the key

50
05:53.840 --> 05:56.210
next let's hide the answer container

51
05:56.420 --> 06:00.950
If there's no answer to be displayed 
so we can go to parent element

52
06:03.900 --> 06:05.250
and add v-if

53
06:08.840 --> 06:11.810
count is greater than zero

54
06:12.730 --> 06:18.840
or we can make it more simpler just like this.

55
06:18.920 --> 06:19.510
All right

56
06:19.670 --> 06:23.660
The last thing that we need to do in this 
template is to change the heading two

57
06:27.120 --> 06:27.780
here

58
06:27.840 --> 06:31.090
let's put this string concatenation into computed property

59
06:33.970 --> 06:39.480
so here we can simply say title

60
06:39.560 --> 06:41.080
Now let's add a script tag

61
06:44.250 --> 06:49.180
lets add props property and in here

62
06:50.080 --> 06:53.600
we need answers and count

63
07:00.750 --> 07:02.780
and then lets also add computed property

64
07:08.270 --> 07:08.850
in here

65
07:08.930 --> 07:17.050
let's define a new method that will house 
the string concatenation for our heading.

66
07:17.100 --> 07:27.930
Here we simply say return this dot count add a space and then

67
07:32.290 --> 07:39.980
if count is greater than 1 we'll say and answers in plural

68
07:40.070 --> 07:42.410
otherwise answer in singular.

69
07:45.920 --> 07:46.470
okay

70
07:46.530 --> 07:49.320
I think that's all we need in this script.

71
07:49.320 --> 07:52.640
Now let's register this answers component globally in app dot

72
07:52.660 --> 07:53.000
js

73
07:58.230 --> 07:59.420
duplicate this line

74
08:03.020 --> 08:12.490
Change the name to answers and then 
require components answers dot vue

75
08:15.630 --> 08:19.950
Now since the answer component will 
only available in answers component

76
08:20.010 --> 08:21.490
So here let's remove this line

77
08:25.210 --> 08:27.130
then back to answers component

78
08:33.040 --> 08:41.770
and then define it here by saying import answer 
from dot forward slash answer dot vue

79
08:48.920 --> 08:50.560
then add components property

80
08:55.990 --> 08:57.020
and add answer.

81
09:03.490 --> 09:05.730
Last let's switch to questions

82
09:07.190 --> 09:12.260
show blade php

83
09:12.450 --> 09:17.880
And then replace this blade include directive with answers

84
09:21.740 --> 09:23.070
bind the answer with

85
09:25.530 --> 09:28.340
question answers

86
09:31.310 --> 09:32.230
bind the count

87
09:35.500 --> 09:37.090
with question

88
09:38.030 --> 09:38.980
answers count

89
09:48.030 --> 09:49.460
let's save all changes

90
09:53.550 --> 09:55.630
and see if everything is still working fine.

91
09:58.630 --> 10:00.570
Oops I forgot to start the server

92
10:05.330 --> 10:18.570
let me run that.

93
10:18.610 --> 10:19.780
Something went wrong

94
10:19.900 --> 10:21.450
all answers are gone.

95
10:21.880 --> 10:23.760
Let me open my browser console.

96
10:26.370 --> 10:29.580
Here I get error count is not defined

97
10:35.080 --> 10:37.330
Here I made mistake it should be

98
10:37.420 --> 10:38.470
this dot count

99
10:45.680 --> 10:49.510
So here I'll change to this dot count save

100
10:52.620 --> 11:01.210
reload

101
11:01.360 --> 11:02.080
All right

102
11:02.080 --> 11:04.450
Now all answers come back. Here

103
11:04.480 --> 11:15.710
I want to make sure that the other components still working.

104
11:15.940 --> 11:17.260
OK so far so good.

105
11:22.680 --> 11:25.460
Now let me open vue developer tool

106
11:30.100 --> 11:32.250
Here we can see the answers component.

107
11:32.260 --> 11:35.610
And inside this component we'll see some answer component.

108
11:42.430 --> 11:42.750
OK

109
11:42.780 --> 11:45.360
That's it for this lesson. In the next lesson

110
11:45.360 --> 11:51.840
We are going to build a feature to load more answers.
So we limit the answers on the first load and then

111
11:51.870 --> 11:59.720
we'll show button on the bottom here and when 
we hit that more answers will be displayed.

112
12:01.590 --> 12:06.290
The button will be hidden when no more answers are found in database.

113
12:06.370 --> 12:12.920
So let's commit all changes to our git repo then 
take a break and join me in the next lesson.
