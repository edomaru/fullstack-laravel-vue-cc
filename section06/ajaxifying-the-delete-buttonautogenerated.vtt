00:03.550 --> 00:08.640
In this lesson are going to AJAXify or implementing 
Ajax on delete answer button.

1
00:08.640 --> 00:11.530
So it doesn't need to refresh the page to see the changes.

2
00:12.950 --> 00:19.770
All right let's switch over to our terminal and 
then create new branch to isolate our work today.

3
00:26.850 --> 00:30.000
Don't forget to run webpack by saying: npm run

4
00:30.030 --> 00:30.390
watch

5
00:37.860 --> 00:38.360
OK

6
00:38.410 --> 00:41.340
firstly let's open _answer.blade.php

7
00:44.360 --> 00:45.660
and then find the delete button

8
00:51.080 --> 00:51.520
OK

9
00:51.520 --> 00:52.150
Here it is.

10
00:55.870 --> 00:58.770
Because we are going to send the delete request through Ajax

11
00:58.780 --> 01:01.360
so here we can move this delete button outside the form.

12
01:06.870 --> 01:08.030
And now we can remove the form

13
01:12.780 --> 01:13.170
here

14
01:13.200 --> 01:14.280
let's cut the confirm

15
01:17.760 --> 01:28.240
and remove the on click atttribute.

16
01:28.350 --> 01:30.400
And let's also remove the type attribute.

17
01:32.560 --> 01:36.620
When we click this button we'll call destroy method.

18
01:37.690 --> 01:41.160
Now we can open Answer.vue file

19
01:50.600 --> 01:54.130
and inside this methods property let's define the destroy method.

20
02:00.990 --> 02:05.310
Inside here let's confirm the deletion by 
paste the confirm to this if statement.

21
02:11.220 --> 02:13.090
And here let's remove the return statement.

22
02:17.360 --> 02:20.390
And inside this if statement we can call axios

23
02:20.660 --> 02:27.690
and delete method and URI  will be the same with update method.

24
02:27.730 --> 02:35.230
So here it will be this endpoint and we will define it shortly.

25
02:49.700 --> 02:55.610
And then when the deletion success we also need toremove 
the answer from the DOM and show a message that

26
02:55.610 --> 02:57.440
sent back from our server.

27
02:57.830 --> 03:02.800
And here's the temporary solution that do 
the trick is by using jQuery fade out method.

28
03:03.960 --> 03:07.870
Specify duration to determine how long the animation will run.

29
03:12.100 --> 03:16.750
And we can also specify callback or what 
to do once the animation is complete

30
03:21.550 --> 03:23.260
for now let's show a message in alert.

31
03:36.250 --> 03:38.830
Now let me cut the URI from this update method.

32
03:41.510 --> 03:45.700
And replace it with this endpoint

33
03:51.370 --> 03:56.130
now inside the computed property 
let's create the endpoint method

34
04:00.780 --> 04:06.650
and here we simply return the URI.  
Last Let's open answers controller

35
04:11.530 --> 04:13.150
then go to destroy method.

36
04:17.180 --> 04:20.080
And here we can say if request

37
04:22.760 --> 04:23.730
expects json

38
04:32.010 --> 04:33.890
then we return json response

39
04:42.580 --> 04:43.740
and it contains a message

40
04:48.120 --> 04:49.780
and I'll copy the message from here.

41
04:54.610 --> 04:55.840
All right let's save all changes.

42
05:01.700 --> 05:02.420
Reload the page.

43
05:07.380 --> 05:12.280
Hit the delete button and hit OK.

44
05:17.960 --> 05:23.310
The deleted answer fade out and we have alert pop up.

45
05:23.400 --> 05:26.740
Let's reload the page to see if the answer is completely removed

46
05:35.840 --> 05:36.640
OK great

47
05:36.650 --> 05:38.760
we have successfully implemented ajax on

48
05:38.770 --> 05:39.720
delete button

49
05:39.770 --> 05:45.310
Now it doesn't need to load the page after 
any answer removed to see the change.

50
05:45.320 --> 05:51.020
However this is not vue js way and this only temporary 
solution in upcoming lesson we'll come back

51
05:51.020 --> 05:53.570
here and we'll see the better way doing this stuff

52
05:53.710 --> 06:00.590
using vue js  reactive system. OK in the next lesson we 
are going to beautify the alert message as well as confirm

53
06:00.590 --> 06:05.570
message so that it will make one application more interesting and look more professional.
