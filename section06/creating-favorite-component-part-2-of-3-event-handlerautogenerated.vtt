00:02.680 --> 00:06.820
All right now let's write the logic to make 
this favorite component actually working

1
00:17.760 --> 00:21.060
here let's v-on click dot prevent

2
00:23.930 --> 00:29.650
because this button will handle two different actions based on value of the use is favorited property

3
00:29.660 --> 00:31.340
So I'm going to call it toggle

4
00:38.250 --> 00:39.780
let's define methods property

5
00:47.240 --> 00:49.180
and here let's define the toggle method.

6
00:58.480 --> 01:03.780
Is the question is favorited we'll call another 
method destory method in this case

7
01:07.030 --> 01:08.810
otherwise we'll call crate method.

8
01:15.800 --> 01:17.190
let's define the destroy method

9
01:22.320 --> 01:24.720
and for now let's decrement the favorite count.

10
01:31.660 --> 01:41.920
And then change the is favorited to false.

11
01:41.960 --> 01:43.230
Let's copy this method.

12
01:50.570 --> 01:51.280
Paste here

13
01:54.710 --> 01:56.060
and chance to create

14
01:59.460 --> 02:02.330
here we need to increment in the favorites count

15
02:06.110 --> 02:08.330
and change the is favorited to true

16
02:12.270 --> 02:16.050
let's save these and let's have a look.

17
02:26.630 --> 02:42.090
Let me inspect elemnt so that I can 
see the changes of the class attribute

18
02:42.100 --> 02:43.720
Now if I hit the favorite button

19
02:48.130 --> 02:54.540
you'll see the favorited class added 
and the favorites count increments.

20
02:54.540 --> 02:55.580
Now if I hit again

21
03:00.030 --> 03:04.990
the number decrement and the favorited class gone.

22
03:05.010 --> 03:05.820
All right

23
03:05.950 --> 03:08.200
Now let's make this changes persistence.

24
03:11.740 --> 03:21.730
Let's reopen the _favorite.blade.php file and here 
we need this URI for both favorite on unfavorite 

25
03:21.730 --> 03:22.680
the question.

26
03:27.540 --> 03:31.130
So let's copy this URI for this purpose

27
03:31.310 --> 03:33.980
we'll need the same URI but different methods.

28
03:34.100 --> 03:39.530
When favoriting the question we'll need post but 
when unfavoriting the question will need delete

29
03:40.920 --> 03:42.990
back to Favorite.vue I'll

30
03:46.230 --> 03:47.660
jump to data method

31
03:51.630 --> 03:54.850
and here I'll assign the question id to id property.

32
03:59.390 --> 04:01.310
And then jump to a computed property

33
04:04.800 --> 04:07.190
and let's define new method endpoint

34
04:07.190 --> 04:07.890
in this case

35
04:14.560 --> 04:16.080
and here we is simply returns the URI.

36
04:24.450 --> 04:41.460
Let's change the question id to this id

37
04:41.470 --> 04:43.630
now we can go to destroy method

38
04:47.130 --> 04:57.340
and in this method we can make delete ajax 
call by saying axios delete this endpoint

39
05:02.130 --> 05:04.360
then let's chain in with then method

40
05:12.810 --> 05:15.200
here we can move this lines inside

41
05:15.230 --> 05:19.750
then method

42
05:19.890 --> 05:26.490
So after deletion succeed decrement the favorites 
count and change the is favorited to false

43
05:29.300 --> 05:30.740
and then in create method

44
05:33.640 --> 05:40.440
we can make post ajax call by saying axios post this endpoint

45
05:47.210 --> 05:48.900
then let's chain in with then method

46
05:56.180 --> 05:59.060
then move these lines inside here

47
06:03.210 --> 06:09.170
Here I think we need to show flash message on this 
component because changing the color on the icon I

48
06:09.180 --> 06:10.710
think is more than enough.

49
06:10.890 --> 06:17.160
But if you want to show the flash message 
I'm sure you already know how to do that.

50
06:17.250 --> 06:20.220
Next up let's open favorites controller

51
06:30.670 --> 06:30.960
here

52
06:30.980 --> 06:36.350
we don't need to return anything 
for both store and destroy method.

53
06:36.420 --> 06:37.600
So here we can select them

54
06:45.510 --> 06:47.270
and remove them.

55
06:49.170 --> 06:55.900
Or we can keep them and return json response 
explicitly such as we did in the previous lesson.

56
06:59.300 --> 07:02.210
If request expects json

57
07:07.490 --> 07:10.270
and then return response json

58
07:18.720 --> 07:21.610
here because we don't need anything to return

59
07:21.840 --> 07:30.120
So here we can set null and we can specify 
header status 204 which indicate that the

60
07:30.120 --> 07:32.140
action was executed successfully

61
07:32.340 --> 07:33.930
but there's no content to return

62
07:39.190 --> 07:40.440
let's save all changes

63
07:43.500 --> 07:44.190
and give it a shot.

64
07:57.960 --> 07:58.660
Hit the star 

65
07:58.670 --> 07:59.200
icon

66
08:02.220 --> 08:04.350
I get error.

67
08:04.350 --> 08:05.490
Let me see in the console

68
08:08.120 --> 08:12.510
here I have error internal server error let me see in the network tab

69
08:16.270 --> 08:23.720
expexts json doesn't exist.

70
08:23.810 --> 08:25.500
Sorry I made typo here.

71
08:28.380 --> 08:30.730
It should be expects json save

72
08:36.000 --> 08:37.410
I'll  clear here

73
08:39.190 --> 08:39.850
also here

74
08:42.610 --> 08:44.100
I'll hit the star icon again.

75
08:45.270 --> 08:46.830
And now I get another error.

76
08:49.360 --> 08:50.990
Let me see in network tab

77
08:55.310 --> 08:56.240
Here's the error

78
08:56.390 --> 08:57.340
Duplicate entry

79
08:57.350 --> 08:58.550
Blah blah blah.

80
09:00.310 --> 09:03.760
This because we only allowed to favorite the question once.

81
09:04.070 --> 09:05.580
So here I need to refresh the page

82
09:11.310 --> 09:19.500
here the icon's color has turned to yellow and the favorites count increment hit again now the color

83
09:19.590 --> 09:22.550
turns to Gray and the favorites count decrement.

84
09:23.190 --> 09:24.430
And if you take a look here

85
09:32.100 --> 09:35.680
here we can see the request being sent.

86
09:35.740 --> 09:40.430
The method is delete and the response no content

87
09:43.240 --> 09:44.000
if we hit again

88
09:47.630 --> 09:49.640
the request method is post.

89
09:49.680 --> 09:50.520
Okay great.
