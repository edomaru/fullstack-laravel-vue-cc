00:03.990 --> 00:07.650
Now let's make this button functional. Let's switch over

1
00:07.690 --> 00:13.530
to our editor. And here in accept 
component we can go to template

2
00:16.900 --> 00:23.570
here we can add v-on click dot prevent equals create

3
00:30.110 --> 00:31.660
so we'll call create method

4
00:31.670 --> 00:37.600
when this button is clicked. And here 
I'll change this v-on: to @ symbol

5
00:44.020 --> 00:44.430
and here

6
00:47.560 --> 00:51.260
I'm going to add id property to hold answer id

7
00:56.250 --> 00:58.210
and then let's define methods property

8
01:10.550 --> 01:11.550
and inside here

9
01:11.720 --> 01:13.070
let's define create method.

10
01:16.170 --> 01:24.420
Here we'll make ajax post request by saying 
axios dot post and let me see the route

11
01:45.900 --> 01:47.770
OK here's the route that we need

12
01:48.690 --> 01:49.350
Let's copy

13
02:00.420 --> 02:01.560
and then paste here.

14
02:08.280 --> 02:11.490
And change this answer to this id

15
02:22.620 --> 02:25.440
then when success will show a flash message

16
02:38.860 --> 02:45.820
here the time out will be three seconds and I'll 
place the flash message on the bottom left

17
02:58.880 --> 03:04.940
and also we need to change the is best to true 
and the temporary solution is by saying

18
03:04.950 --> 03:11.040
this is best equal true.

19
03:11.150 --> 03:13.270
Again this is just temporary solution

20
03:13.370 --> 03:17.080
and in the future lesson we'll come back here and fix this issue.

21
03:19.230 --> 03:23.340
last we can open accept answer controller

22
03:31.540 --> 03:33.690
here we'll return json response

23
03:34.180 --> 03:36.250
if the expected response is json

24
03:52.020 --> 03:53.610
and here I'll return a message

25
03:56.770 --> 03:59.050
and I'm going to say "you have accepted

26
04:02.430 --> 04:04.530
this answer as best answer".

27
04:07.460 --> 04:10.190
one last thing let's reopen the answer model

28
04:21.310 --> 04:23.770
and add is best in this appends attribute

29
04:32.800 --> 04:33.870
and give it a try.

30
04:36.520 --> 04:40.840
To test this you have to find a question 
that own by the current user signed in

31
04:44.570 --> 04:45.540
reload the page. I'll hit

32
04:56.370 --> 04:57.390
this accept answer.

33
05:00.700 --> 05:06.730
Something went wrong. Here I have two 
accept buttons. This is not what we expect.

34
05:07.100 --> 05:08.090
Let's see our code

35
05:11.980 --> 05:13.530
switch to accept dot vue

36
05:23.110 --> 05:23.500
ok

37
05:23.570 --> 05:28.660
Firstly here we need to change these to

38
05:28.670 --> 05:32.220
This is best because as you can see

39
05:35.420 --> 05:36.830
after we hit the button

40
05:37.130 --> 05:39.090
we change the is best to true

41
05:39.260 --> 05:46.010
So is best initially store the is best from answer 
instance but then when we hit the accept button we

42
05:46.010 --> 05:47.330
change it true

43
05:47.420 --> 05:55.940
That's why I accepted method relies on the local is best 
property and then in this classes method it doesn't relies

44
05:56.030 --> 06:01.820
on the accepted method because it does not care 
whether a current user can accept the question or not.

45
06:02.030 --> 06:04.580
Instead it depends on local is best

46
06:09.230 --> 06:10.270
we need to change

47
06:10.370 --> 06:11.730
this to accepted

48
06:16.580 --> 06:23.120
because remember this elements only appear if the 
current user has no authorization to accept the answer

49
06:23.450 --> 06:25.440
and the answer has been accepted as best

50
06:25.560 --> 06:26.030
answer.

51
06:34.130 --> 06:35.130
Reload again.

52
06:38.750 --> 06:41.750
Here we can see that this answer accepted as best answer.

53
06:42.020 --> 06:44.100
indicate in green color.

54
06:44.530 --> 06:47.390
Now if we hit the accept button on another answer

55
06:50.450 --> 06:57.450
here we have flash message pop up 
and the icon's color turns to green.

56
06:57.450 --> 06:59.820
Now here we'll have two answers in green color

57
07:04.090 --> 07:05.440
but if we reload the page

58
07:10.760 --> 07:17.390
we'll have one answer Mark as best answer. We'll 
leave this issue and we'll come back to fix this issue

59
07:17.720 --> 07:18.920
in the upcoming lesson.

60
07:21.170 --> 07:24.000
Now if you see other question by anyone else

61
07:35.900 --> 07:40.290
here we'll also see the accept appear. 
Of course if we hit the button

62
07:43.740 --> 07:49.410
we don't see any changes or flash message. 
if we open the developer tool

63
07:54.120 --> 07:59.920
here we have error forbidden response which 
means we have an authorization error. 

64
08:00.480 --> 08:06.600
So in this case you could be catch the error and 
show it into error flash message. But I think we don't

65
08:06.600 --> 08:07.500
need to do that.

66
08:08.660 --> 08:13.880
Because in the next lesson we are going to rewrite the authorization logic into javascript code and this

67
08:13.880 --> 08:15.310
issue should  be fixed.

68
08:18.870 --> 08:19.260
OK

69
08:19.310 --> 08:19.940
That's it.

70
08:20.210 --> 08:21.630
Let's take a break.

71
08:21.650 --> 08:23.300
Don't forget to commit all changes

72
08:23.390 --> 08:26.430
to your bit repo. So I'll see you in the next lesson.
