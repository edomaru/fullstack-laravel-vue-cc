00:01.590 --> 00:07.320
In this lesson we're going to rewrite the favourite button 
into vue js component and make it more interactive

1
00:07.410 --> 00:09.420
by implementing ajax.

2
00:09.420 --> 00:14.010
All right let's open up our terminal and then create new branch

3
00:21.550 --> 00:27.770
Now let's open up shared _favorite.blade.php

4
00:31.360 --> 00:33.430
and here let's copy this in anchor tag

5
00:39.000 --> 00:45.830
and then let's go to assets js components 
folder and create new component.

6
00:47.300 --> 00:49.190
let's called the Favorite.vue add

7
00:54.870 --> 00:59.180
template tag and paste the code

8
01:05.660 --> 01:06.340
here

9
01:06.420 --> 01:09.140
We are going to utilize the vue js v-on directive

10
01:09.280 --> 01:11.020
So let's remove this on click attribute

11
01:21.770 --> 01:31.780
and here the favorite button depends 
on is favorited and favorites count

12
01:31.970 --> 01:36.840
and also authentication to determine 
the additional class for the anchor.

13
01:37.310 --> 01:39.250
So let's provide that in our script.

14
01:42.310 --> 01:43.810
so let's add script tag

15
01:46.390 --> 01:56.590
define props property and it should be contains question.

16
01:56.870 --> 01:58.530
And then let's define data method

17
02:02.030 --> 02:03.140
return object

18
02:06.300 --> 02:09.950
and inside here let's define is favorited

19
02:12.190 --> 02:17.400
And it hold this question is favorited

20
02:21.330 --> 02:34.730
then count and it hold this question favorites count.

21
02:34.890 --> 02:39.830
Note that both of these are accessor 
so letter we'll have to define them in

22
02:39.920 --> 02:40.890
appends attribute

23
02:40.890 --> 02:42.050
in the question model

24
02:45.060 --> 02:51.920
now the temporary solution for dealing with authentication 
is by define a variable let's say signed in

25
02:55.020 --> 02:58.020
and here I'll set the value with true. Later

26
02:58.020 --> 03:00.660
we'll come back here and fix this.

27
03:00.900 --> 03:02.630
Now we can define computed property

28
03:12.290 --> 03:20.820
and inside here let's define a method to put this logic.

29
03:21.080 --> 03:22.500
Let's call it classes

30
03:27.540 --> 03:29.180
here we simply return an array

31
03:34.270 --> 03:35.310
contains classes

32
03:39.500 --> 03:42.250
favorite mt-2`

33
03:51.030 --> 03:57.750
and then for the last class it will be `off` if user not signed

34
03:57.750 --> 04:06.500
in otherwise it will be `favorited` if user has signed 
in and has favorited the question or it will

35
04:06.500 --> 04:17.040
be nothing if two conditions not met.

36
04:17.160 --> 04:21.180
So if user not signed in return off

37
04:25.530 --> 04:33.580
or if user has signed in and the question 
has been favorited return fovorited class.

38
04:33.710 --> 04:37.650
otherwise return empty.

39
04:37.730 --> 04:47.340
Now we can go back to our template and change  
the span's text with count as we defined here. 

40
04:50.880 --> 04:53.070
Then let's remove everything inside class attribute

41
04:58.760 --> 05:01.310
and then bind the class attribute to classes

42
05:04.470 --> 05:13.660
like we have defined in computed property here 
and here we should use class binding. Alright 

43
05:13.660 --> 05:21.540
now we can go to app.js in assets folder 
and register our favorite component.

44
05:34.420 --> 05:34.960
Now let's

45
05:34.980 --> 05:40.480
open up _vote.blade.php shared folder

46
05:47.560 --> 06:06.820
and here we can replace this with our new favorite component.

47
06:06.840 --> 06:08.700
Next we can open question model

48
06:12.410 --> 06:16.180
and add is favorited and favorites count inside appends attribute.

49
06:21.340 --> 06:21.790
All right let's

50
06:21.860 --> 06:22.670
save all changes

51
06:25.480 --> 06:26.410
and have a look.

52
06:28.510 --> 06:32.340
Here I haven't run the webpack so let me run that

53
06:42.150 --> 06:42.580
OK

54
06:42.660 --> 06:45.390
Let's have a look reload the page.

55
06:49.410 --> 06:50.640
I'll open developer tool

56
06:53.880 --> 06:54.200
here

57
06:54.220 --> 06:57.100
I have no error if I go to

58
06:57.100 --> 06:57.810
vue dev tool

59
07:02.250 --> 07:04.160
here I can  see the favorite component.

60
07:11.760 --> 07:13.280
it look no difference

61
07:17.180 --> 07:19.790
But if I change the sign in to false

62
07:23.120 --> 07:30.720
and then reload the page here will see 
the icons color turns to a bit like gray.

63
07:31.220 --> 07:34.110
OK here let me change the signed in back to true.
