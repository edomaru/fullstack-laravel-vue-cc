00:02.880 --> 00:08.180
In the previous lesson we have rewritten 
the favorite button into vue js component.

1
00:08.210 --> 00:12.310
Now in this lesson we are going to 
do almost the same thing to this accept

2
00:12.320 --> 00:14.610
answer button.

3
00:14.660 --> 00:20.920
All right let's switch over to our terminal and create new branch by saying git checkout

4
00:21.090 --> 00:23.730
-b lesson-33

5
00:26.700 --> 00:33.580
and don't forget to run web pack by saying npm run watch.

6
00:34.710 --> 00:35.440
OK

7
00:35.690 --> 00:47.330
Now let's open _vote.blade.php and as you can see in 
else statement we call shared underscore accept blade

8
00:47.360 --> 00:50.020
php. So let's opened that file

9
00:58.230 --> 01:01.190
as you can see in this file

10
01:01.290 --> 01:07.150
we need to authorize the current 
user signed in to show the button.

11
01:07.340 --> 01:13.290
That means we need to think how to keep this authorization 
working when we rewritten these into new

12
01:13.310 --> 01:14.070
component.

13
01:15.120 --> 01:19.680
For now we're going to hard code it 
and in the next lesson we'll rewrite

14
01:19.680 --> 01:27.670
the authorization logic into javascript so that it can 
be applied in our component. OK let's copy

15
01:27.670 --> 01:28.450
everything.

16
01:29.590 --> 01:44.660
Then go to assets js components folder here 
let's create new file and call it accept dot vue

17
01:44.710 --> 02:00.770
Inside here let's add template tag add 
a div and then paste the markup.

18
02:00.860 --> 02:15.380
We don't need to use a form here so let's 
remove the on click attribute from here.

19
02:15.480 --> 02:23.690
And let's also remove the form.

20
02:23.790 --> 02:28.620
Now before we remove the laravel autorization 
checking Let's add script tag below

21
02:37.570 --> 02:50.870
and Firstly let's add props property to indicate 
that this component needs answer as input

22
02:51.020 --> 02:52.940
and then let's add computed property.

23
02:56.760 --> 02:58.010
and here let's hard code

24
02:58.020 --> 03:00.070
the authorization logic.

25
03:00.070 --> 03:02.350
Again this only temporary solution

26
03:02.490 --> 03:06.290
and in the next lesson we'll come back here and fix this.

27
03:07.030 --> 03:11.730
OK let's define a method to check if the 
current user can accept the answer.

28
03:11.730 --> 03:13.800
I'm going to call it can accept

29
03:18.770 --> 03:20.570
and for now it will be returned true.

30
03:26.150 --> 03:31.560
and the second method is a method to check if the current user is cannot accept the answer

31
03:31.710 --> 03:34.350
and the answer has been accepted as best answer.

32
03:34.680 --> 03:36.870
And here I'm going to call it is best.

33
03:41.110 --> 03:43.150
here we simply say return

34
03:48.000 --> 03:48.920
this can accept

35
03:52.230 --> 03:56.310
and this answer is best.

36
03:59.550 --> 04:02.010
basically this logic simplify

37
04:04.990 --> 04:07.750
this else if 

38
04:07.840 --> 04:13.630
statement.

39
04:13.890 --> 04:21.320
And then here he can conditionally show this anchor 
by utilizing v-if directive but before that let's

40
04:21.320 --> 04:22.100
remove this blade if

41
04:22.310 --> 04:23.360
statement from here

42
04:35.300 --> 04:36.530
and now here we can say v-if

43
04:39.740 --> 04:40.460
can accept

44
04:44.480 --> 04:45.980
and then also let's remove these

45
04:57.740 --> 05:05.630
and then we can conditionally show this 
second anchor by saying v-if is best

46
05:09.180 --> 05:15.590
and the last thing that we need 
to change here is model status.

47
05:15.590 --> 05:18.860
Let's see what's going on behind this accessor.

48
05:18.920 --> 05:20.330
Let's open answer model

49
05:26.420 --> 05:29.930
and then jump to get status attribute

50
05:34.330 --> 05:37.020
it's basically return vote accepted class

51
05:37.310 --> 05:44.740
if the answer has been accepted. I think now we can 
place this logic in our companion and it will be

52
05:44.740 --> 05:45.680
much easier.

53
05:46.580 --> 05:47.920
So let's copy this logic

54
05:54.890 --> 05:56.090
let's define data method

55
06:00.200 --> 06:08.140
and here let's define a property called 
is best and it holds this answer

56
06:09.010 --> 06:16.750
is best.

57
06:16.890 --> 06:18.470
And in this computed property

58
06:23.800 --> 06:25.720
let's create a method called classes

59
06:31.630 --> 06:32.700
return an array

60
06:33.990 --> 06:42.150
contains bootstrap mt-2 class or margin top two like we call here

61
06:54.650 --> 06:56.050
and paste the previous logic

62
07:00.320 --> 07:01.850
and then change this to

63
07:05.470 --> 07:07.360
this is best

64
07:12.010 --> 07:18.530
and remove the semi colon.

65
07:18.600 --> 07:26.440
Now we can remove the model status from both anchors 
and instead we'll be binding the class attribute to classes.

66
07:35.060 --> 07:38.570
All right now we can register this component in app.js

67
07:45.870 --> 07:47.270
Duplicate this line

68
07:49.710 --> 07:51.960
Let's change the first argument to accept

69
07:56.760 --> 07:59.580
and the second argument require component

70
07:59.700 --> 08:06.980
accept.vue

71
08:07.080 --> 08:10.540
Now we can reopen _vote.blade.php

72
08:13.380 --> 08:17.170
and replace this line with our newest component

73
08:29.450 --> 08:30.460
let's save all changes and

74
08:35.940 --> 08:36.830
have a look.

75
08:47.340 --> 08:48.750
Something went wrong.

76
08:49.050 --> 08:57.430
Let me open my browser console.

77
08:57.640 --> 08:57.890
I have error

78
09:02.730 --> 09:04.740
data function should return an object

79
09:10.340 --> 09:23.200
here in data let's cut this return an 
object and paste here. Save reload again.

80
09:28.940 --> 09:30.370
Here I have another error.

81
09:31.470 --> 09:34.950
The computed property isBest is already defined in data

82
09:38.510 --> 09:39.520
OK

83
09:39.810 --> 09:46.050
here I have defined is best in  data method and 
in computed property defined a method in the

84
09:46.050 --> 09:46.870
same name.

85
09:46.900 --> 09:53.720
So remember don't use the same 
name in data and computed property.

86
09:53.880 --> 09:58.050
Maybe we can change this to accepted

87
10:04.600 --> 10:05.400
reload again.

88
10:09.240 --> 10:09.740
OK

89
10:09.820 --> 10:21.760
Now I have no error.

90
10:21.910 --> 10:26.030
Now you'll see the accept button will appear in all answers.

91
10:26.620 --> 10:28.530
But don't worry we'll fix this issue later.
