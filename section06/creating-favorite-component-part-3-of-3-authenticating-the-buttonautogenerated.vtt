00:04.410 --> 00:11.630
Now obviously this favorite button should work only for  
signed in user so to fix this let's switch back over to

1
00:11.730 --> 00:15.920
our editor go to favorite.vue

2
00:21.420 --> 00:30.780
and here in toggle method we can check if 
the user not sign in like so if not signed in

3
00:34.830 --> 00:36.330
then we'll show warning message

4
00:41.620 --> 00:45.480
here I'm going to say please login to favorite

5
00:52.660 --> 00:55.660
this question.

6
00:55.780 --> 01:01.460
The title is going to be warning and here I'll define some options

7
01:04.700 --> 01:05.930
here I'll set the time out

8
01:06.020 --> 01:07.100
to three seconds and I'll

9
01:12.130 --> 01:14.320
place the flash message on the bottom left

10
01:26.660 --> 01:33.560
and don't forget to add return statement otherwise 
the code outside if statement will be keep executed

11
01:37.260 --> 01:38.280
Let's have the change

12
01:44.010 --> 01:47.270
and Firstly let's make sure everything is still working fine.

13
01:57.720 --> 01:59.260
OK it's still working fine.

14
02:01.020 --> 02:03.390
No let me change the sign in to false

15
02:10.590 --> 02:11.490
reload again.

16
02:17.740 --> 02:20.700
Here are the icon's color turns to light gray.

17
02:21.340 --> 02:22.270
If I hit this icon here I

18
02:25.300 --> 02:27.350
get a warning message on the bottom left.

19
02:27.370 --> 02:27.750
Great

20
02:34.320 --> 02:35.670
now to finish this lesson

21
02:35.800 --> 02:37.790
let's fix this authentication issue.

22
02:38.940 --> 02:43.490
Right now we hard coded  it here.

23
02:43.630 --> 02:50.300
Now the way that we can do is to get the current user 
info from the session and store it to somewhere

24
02:50.360 --> 02:53.810
so that it will be accessible in javascript code.

25
02:53.810 --> 02:57.660
Do you have any idea? in this case

26
02:57.730 --> 03:02.620
I think the best way to do that is to store the
current user info into javascript window global

27
03:02.640 --> 03:06.810
object.

28
03:06.900 --> 03:10.070
So let's open layouts app.blade.php

29
03:25.420 --> 03:27.460
and here let's move this script to the bottom.

30
03:34.870 --> 03:40.800
Let's remove the defer attribute because 
now we'll place our script on the bottom.

31
03:41.020 --> 03:44.490
And before we load this app.js file Let's add another script

32
03:53.110 --> 03:56.710
and here of some of the current user info in window global object

33
04:01.920 --> 04:09.220
and then auth or you can call it whatever you like of course.

34
04:09.490 --> 04:11.860
In this case we'll use blade non escaping syntax

35
04:17.270 --> 04:19.900
because this auth needs pure data in javascript

36
04:19.930 --> 04:20.390
Object

37
04:25.990 --> 04:34.780
this auth will store sign in to store the 
state of the user in boolean value

38
04:41.700 --> 04:42.390
and user

39
04:45.100 --> 04:53.990
to store the current user sign in an object.

40
04:54.110 --> 04:55.820
And we need to convert this to json

41
04:59.940 --> 05:02.080
using php json function like this

42
05:07.280 --> 05:10.450
so that they will be recognized by javascript.

43
05:10.710 --> 05:13.660
Let's save and have a look.

44
05:17.270 --> 05:21.080
Reload the page.

45
05:21.270 --> 05:22.380
And then view page source.

46
05:36.270 --> 05:46.860
as you can see here the window auth holds object 
contains sign in and user. The sign in is true because

47
05:46.890 --> 05:53.870
I have already signed in and the user holds current object.

48
05:53.880 --> 05:56.530
Now we can switch to favorite.vue

49
05:59.720 --> 06:06.000
remove the signed in from this data method 
and then inside the computer property

50
06:08.890 --> 06:10.030
let's defined signed in method

51
06:17.880 --> 06:21.200
and here we simply return window auth

52
06:25.060 --> 06:25.750
signed in

53
06:39.430 --> 06:40.330
reload the page

54
06:44.050 --> 06:44.410
OK

55
06:44.420 --> 06:46.830
I think it's still working as it was.

56
06:46.900 --> 06:47.900
Now let me copy this

57
06:47.900 --> 06:52.980
URL and then I'll open incognito window

58
06:57.010 --> 06:58.360
and then I'll paste the URL

59
07:04.190 --> 07:08.400
as you can see here the color of the 
favorite button looks a bit like gray.

60
07:08.730 --> 07:09.750
And if I hit that

61
07:12.950 --> 07:14.490
I'll get a warning message.

62
07:18.900 --> 07:19.420
All right

63
07:19.450 --> 07:24.830
We have successfully created or I can say rewrite 
our favorite button into vue js components

64
07:25.000 --> 07:30.990
and it also worked as before but now it doesn't 
need to reload the page to see the change.

65
07:31.360 --> 07:37.620
and this makes our application more interactive. In the 
next lesson we are going to rewrite the accept answer

66
07:37.620 --> 07:39.660
button into vue js component.

67
07:40.030 --> 07:41.950
So let's commit our changes

68
07:42.160 --> 07:44.710
then take a break and join me in the next lesson.
