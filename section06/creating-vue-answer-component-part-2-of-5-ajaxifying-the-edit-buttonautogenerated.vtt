Currently if we hit the edit button we'll be taken 
to another page. To make it more interactive

1
00:14.530 --> 00:16.170
let's change its behavior.

2
00:16.180 --> 00:22.060
We'll put this answer form in the same page in the 
same position where the answer stay or in a simple

3
00:22.060 --> 00:24.430
term we'll make it as inline form.

4
00:27.630 --> 00:29.810
All right let's switch back over to our editor

5
00:32.560 --> 00:33.940
in here in this file

6
00:34.930 --> 00:37.260
firstly we need to changed how the edit button

7
00:37.270 --> 00:37.780
behaves.

8
00:47.850 --> 00:49.440
Let's remove the `href` attribute

9
00:55.830 --> 00:58.680
and then we need to attach an event listener to this button.

10
00:59.860 --> 01:07.930
We can do that by utilizing `v-on` directive. This directive 
needs an argument which is type of the event

11
01:09.060 --> 01:13.120
it could be click double click etc.

12
01:13.140 --> 01:20.550
In this case we'll need click event so we can say v-on click equals

13
01:23.880 --> 01:25.950
and then with the specified expression here

14
01:29.590 --> 01:35.020
the expression can be inline statesman or method 
name. Here the expression will be inline statement

15
01:35.040 --> 01:36.620
like this.

16
01:36.760 --> 01:38.260
editing equal true

17
01:42.940 --> 01:48.700
the editing is a variable to control the state of 
the form. When it's true the form will be shown.

18
01:48.700 --> 01:52.390
Otherwise when it's false the form will be hidden.

19
01:52.390 --> 01:57.760
When working with event we can utilize 
something called modifiers. Modifiers

20
01:57.890 --> 02:04.030
are directive postfixes denoted by dot indicating 
that a directive should be bound in some special

21
02:04.030 --> 02:04.500
way.

22
02:05.670 --> 02:07.980
So here we can add on  v-on click

23
02:11.340 --> 02:19.160
dot prevent the prevent the link to follow the URL. 
we have removed the URL from this anchor

24
02:19.720 --> 02:25.440
but this way I think is much better because we can 
modify the link easily in the browser on the fly.

25
02:27.130 --> 02:33.680
By specifying the prevent here it will make sure 
that this link will not follow the URL anymore.

26
02:33.780 --> 02:36.870
And here we can use the shorthand syntax for the v-on

27
02:39.810 --> 02:40.560
just like this

28
02:43.910 --> 02:44.350
okay

29
02:44.390 --> 02:53.290
here we need to define this editing variable and we can 
define that in answer component. Let's switch to answer

30
02:53.310 --> 02:54.130
dot vue file.

31
02:58.750 --> 03:00.310
Here let's define data method

32
03:03.530 --> 03:05.060
then return an object.

33
03:08.280 --> 03:10.950
And instead here we define editing property.

34
03:13.880 --> 03:15.360
And it should be false by default

35
03:18.670 --> 03:22.720
which mean the edit answer form is hidden by default.

36
03:22.720 --> 03:27.540
Next let's determine which part will be hidden 
or shown when the added bonus clicked.

37
03:35.340 --> 03:40.290
In my opinion it would be better 
to hide this answer body buttons

38
03:45.400 --> 03:46.990
and user info when editing

39
03:52.220 --> 03:53.520
so let's wrap this

40
03:53.840 --> 03:57.410
body html and the row in another div.

41
04:14.080 --> 04:16.760
and then above that let's add a form

42
04:25.720 --> 04:27.050
for now let's display a message

43
04:32.640 --> 04:34.230
and let's also add an update button.

44
04:48.980 --> 04:50.180
when the button is clicked

45
04:50.180 --> 04:54.350
we change the editing to false which 
means the answer form will be hidden.

46
04:57.280 --> 05:02.870
And to toggle between the elements we can 
utilize vue js  conditional rendering like this

47
05:06.610 --> 05:07.030
v-if

48
05:07.030 --> 05:14.860
so v-if directive will conditionally render the element 
based on the trueness of the expression value.

49
05:15.070 --> 05:20.920
If the value is true this form will be shown 
otherwise if it falls this form will be hidden.

50
05:22.390 --> 05:25.990
So here we can pass in the editing as expression like so

51
05:35.840 --> 05:38.000
or we can make it more simpler just like this

52
05:45.360 --> 05:52.360
now here we need kind of the opposite condition 
of this element it should be appear when editing is

53
05:52.360 --> 05:53.030
false

54
05:54.070 --> 05:56.360
and disappears when editing is true.

55
05:56.710 --> 05:59.690
Here we can say v-if

56
06:03.420 --> 06:07.140
editing is equals false.

57
06:08.400 --> 06:11.180
Or in simple form we can write it like this

58
06:17.010 --> 06:20.490
or we can make it more simpler by utilizing v-else directive

59
06:20.490 --> 06:20.940
like so

60
06:28.930 --> 06:37.070
please note that when you're using v-if and v-else 
both elements should be in the same level. Let's save

61
06:37.080 --> 06:39.190
all changes and see how it look.

62
06:51.240 --> 06:54.160
You can find an editable answer here I have it.

63
06:57.180 --> 07:04.110
Let's hit the button here's the answer body disappear 
and we have edit answer form message

64
07:04.130 --> 07:04.730
show up.

65
07:06.530 --> 07:07.530
hit the update button

66
07:10.800 --> 07:12.620
the message disappear

67
07:12.690 --> 07:19.140
while our answer body came back and it's also 
reload the page but don't worry we'll fix that letter.
