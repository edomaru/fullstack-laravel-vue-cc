00:04.690 --> 00:08.330
Now, I'll undo the change.

1
00:08.620 --> 00:10.680
I'll keep calling can accept here.

2
00:18.400 --> 00:22.360
And I'll put the authorization checking in this method

3
00:25.200 --> 00:29.940
here we can say return this dot

4
00:29.970 --> 00:30.620
authorize accept

5
00:36.330 --> 00:37.400
this answer

6
00:41.530 --> 00:44.930
let's save and let's make sure everything is working fine.

7
01:01.100 --> 01:01.460
OK

8
01:01.480 --> 01:02.830
so far so good.

9
01:10.290 --> 01:16.080
Now let's refactor our app dot js file by moving 
the authorization logic into another place.

10
01:17.670 --> 01:21.660
So let's go to assets

11
01:21.930 --> 01:22.730
js folder

12
01:25.490 --> 01:31.780
and create a new directory here I'm going to call authorization

13
01:38.210 --> 01:42.990
now let's move the policies dot js 
file into our authorization directory

14
01:50.360 --> 01:51.580
here will get the error

15
01:51.590 --> 02:03.550
but don't worry we'll fix shortly

16
02:03.840 --> 02:08.980
after that let's create new file

17
02:09.060 --> 02:11.280
I'm going to call it authorize

18
02:11.340 --> 02:11.780
dot js

19
02:17.840 --> 02:20.330
and we'll place the authorization logic inside here.

20
02:21.730 --> 02:24.510
I'll switch to app.js

21
02:27.170 --> 02:28.640
select the authorization logic

22
02:39.020 --> 02:40.200
and paste here.

23
02:47.200 --> 02:48.450
And here I'll make  a simple

24
02:48.460 --> 02:51.460
vue js plug in like this export default

25
02:54.230 --> 02:57.050
install vue options

26
03:01.720 --> 03:06.660
and then move the authorize function inside here.

27
03:10.110 --> 03:13.430
And here we don't need to import the vue js instance

28
03:15.360 --> 03:19.710
because the view here this refers to vue in this argument

29
03:25.120 --> 03:31.540
and here I also want to place the signed variable 
in the vue js prototype so that it can be accessible

30
03:31.900 --> 03:45.710
in all components.

31
03:45.700 --> 03:51.400
Now we can go back to app.js and utilize our authorization plug in

32
03:57.540 --> 03:59.780
Firstly let's import the authorize file

33
04:20.300 --> 04:35.020
and then integrated with vue js by saying vue use authorization.

34
04:35.140 --> 04:36.450
One last more thing.

35
04:37.540 --> 04:45.590
Since we have defined the signed in in vue js 
prototype so let's open favorite component

36
04:55.150 --> 05:00.210
and then here we don't need this signed 
in in this computed property anymore.

37
05:05.410 --> 05:06.410
Save all changes

38
05:12.140 --> 05:15.030
and let's see if everything working fine as we expect.

39
05:35.660 --> 05:36.560
There is no error

40
05:47.730 --> 05:50.120
OK great we have successfully rewritten

41
05:50.130 --> 05:55.710
the authorization policy into javascript and it's really 
working in vue js components. In the next lesson

42
05:55.720 --> 06:01.940
and we are going to continue building our project 
and rewrite the vote control into vue js component.

43
06:02.320 --> 06:07.530
So let's commit all changes to our git repo and 
then take a quick break and join me in the next

44
06:07.530 --> 06:08.190
lesson.
