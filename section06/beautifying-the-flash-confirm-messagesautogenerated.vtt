00:02.420 --> 00:07.750
In this lesson we're going to beautify the flash message 
as well as confirm message so that it will make

1
00:07.750 --> 00:12.470
our application more interesting and 
look more professional. To do that

2
00:12.490 --> 00:16.150
well not to install third party package called izi toast.

3
00:16.150 --> 00:19.940
So this is the izi toast official website as you can see

4
00:19.960 --> 00:25.690
this package provides some different types of 
messages that you can try out such as success

5
00:29.150 --> 00:29.600
warning

6
00:32.430 --> 00:34.270
error etc.

7
00:37.960 --> 00:41.920
and this package is the same package
but with the vue js integration.

8
00:42.130 --> 00:43.620
So this package is built on top

9
00:43.660 --> 00:48.160
izi toast to make integration with the vue js more easier.

10
00:48.180 --> 00:52.870
So instead of install this package  we're going to install this one

11
01:08.120 --> 01:09.160
let's copy this command

12
01:12.090 --> 01:13.260
go to our terminal

13
01:17.680 --> 01:19.870
and before we paste and run the command

14
01:19.870 --> 01:22.120
don't forget to isolate our work in new branch

15
01:29.150 --> 01:29.780
also

16
01:29.830 --> 01:31.790
let's run npm run watch

17
01:37.890 --> 01:39.240
here I'll open new terminal

18
01:44.580 --> 01:50.100
paste and -D to indicate that this package is for development only

19
01:55.650 --> 01:56.630
while it's install

20
01:56.730 --> 01:57.900
let's see the configuration

21
02:07.120 --> 02:08.110
here we need to import

22
02:08.110 --> 02:11.530
the vue izi toast core package

23
02:11.660 --> 02:13.360
izi toast stylesheet

24
02:13.590 --> 02:18.160
and use it in vue instance. So let's copy this line

25
02:23.010 --> 02:29.200
let's switch over to our editor and we'll place 
them in the main javascript file which is app.js

26
02:32.780 --> 02:33.980
Let's open that file.

27
02:38.650 --> 02:39.910
And Paste the code here.

28
02:47.710 --> 02:49.070
Now let's see how to use it.

29
02:57.210 --> 03:05.050
OK here we can call this toast and then 
you can call show, info, success etc.

30
03:05.670 --> 03:12.600
The first argument is the message and the second
one is title and the third one is the option

31
03:17.260 --> 03:18.900
let's open Answer.vue

32
03:22.640 --> 03:24.990
and go to update method

33
03:29.810 --> 03:35.220
and here let's replace this alert with this toast

34
03:35.560 --> 03:42.110
success. This will be the message let's specify the title success

35
03:42.130 --> 03:42.760
In this case.

36
03:47.340 --> 03:51.130
And here also I'll specify option time out to three seconds

37
03:56.270 --> 03:57.240
let's copy this line

38
04:00.800 --> 04:06.110
and paste inside this catch method change the message to error

39
04:09.270 --> 04:16.720
here we need to change error response data message.

40
04:16.960 --> 04:18.400
The title will be error

41
04:22.080 --> 04:27.270
and remove this line. Now let's do 
the same thing to destroy method

42
04:31.400 --> 04:34.670
select alert and replace with izi toast

43
04:37.550 --> 04:38.820
alright let's save all changes

44
04:42.200 --> 04:43.360
and let's give it a try.

45
04:49.790 --> 04:50.740
reload the page

46
04:54.140 --> 04:55.280
edit an answer

47
04:59.330 --> 05:00.190
and hit update button.

48
05:04.180 --> 05:05.000
as you can see

49
05:05.050 --> 05:11.630
now we have beautiful flash message on the bottom left.

50
05:11.740 --> 05:18.310
Now if you want to custom the position of 
the flash message go to izi toast official 

51
05:18.310 --> 05:28.640
web site and go to documentation.

52
05:28.800 --> 05:38.890
Here you can find various options that you can adjust to custom the flash message behaviour.

53
05:39.010 --> 05:43.010
Before we try to delete an answer let's 
also change a native confirm with

54
05:43.020 --> 05:44.300
izi toast.

55
05:44.680 --> 05:47.090
So if you see in the izi toast official Web site

56
05:49.990 --> 05:51.860
it provides a confirm like this.

57
05:54.290 --> 05:58.320
Here we don't need select instead will show yes no cancel button

58
06:01.470 --> 06:02.460
So let's see the code

59
06:14.360 --> 06:15.720
copy everything here.

60
06:19.120 --> 06:20.430
Got to destory method

61
06:23.870 --> 06:24.640
and paste here

62
06:37.650 --> 06:42.420
here we don't need this functions so let's remove them from here.

63
06:47.430 --> 06:48.650
Let's move this lines

64
06:53.680 --> 06:55.480
inside yes callback function here

65
07:01.280 --> 07:01.690
and here

66
07:01.690 --> 07:16.460
we don't need this confirm anymore.

67
07:16.470 --> 07:16.950
All right

68
07:17.000 --> 07:23.580
let's save this and give it a try.

69
07:23.590 --> 07:24.560
Reload the page

70
07:27.330 --> 07:28.860
and try to delete an answer.

71
07:31.490 --> 07:34.890
It's not working

72
07:34.930 --> 07:36.250
Let me open my console

73
07:43.770 --> 07:44.120
here

74
07:44.130 --> 07:44.950
I forgot to change

75
07:44.980 --> 07:48.860
this izi toast here

76
07:48.890 --> 07:52.220
I need to change this to this toast

77
08:01.280 --> 08:07.050
and here let's cut this message and put it in the first argument.

78
08:07.670 --> 08:08.960
And let's also add title

79
08:14.700 --> 08:15.640
and reload the page

80
08:19.300 --> 08:19.820
OK

81
08:19.830 --> 08:22.880
Now I have no error.

82
08:22.930 --> 08:27.210
I'll hit the delete button.

83
08:27.280 --> 08:29.360
Now we have beautiful confirmation pop up.

84
08:29.700 --> 08:30.750
If I hit yes

85
08:33.460 --> 08:34.720
Nothing changed

86
08:35.160 --> 08:40.610
And here in the console we have another error 
cannot read property endpoint of undefined.

87
08:41.870 --> 08:47.360
Let me see my code.

88
08:47.470 --> 08:53.500
All right here we need to change this function to arrow 
function because when we are using function

89
08:54.750 --> 08:58.120
`this` will refer to the object that was created inside this function.

90
09:00.070 --> 09:05.720
While in arrow function `this` will refer to the value of 
`this` in the environment where the error function

91
09:05.720 --> 09:06.280
is defined

92
09:12.870 --> 09:15.230
let's save and give it another try.

93
09:24.460 --> 09:25.290
Delete an answer

94
09:29.460 --> 09:34.510
and hit yes.

95
09:34.550 --> 09:37.970
Now the deleted answer disappear 
and the flash message show up.

96
09:43.250 --> 09:46.240
All right so now we have successfully integrated izi toast

97
09:46.250 --> 09:51.110
in our application and it make our flash message 
and confirmation dialog much beautiful.

98
09:54.290 --> 09:59.560
In the next lesson we're going to rewrite 
this favourite button into vue js component.

99
09:59.570 --> 10:02.660
So let's commit all changes and I'll see you in a second.
