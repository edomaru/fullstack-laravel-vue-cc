00:03.990 --> 00:13.570
Last let's see how our validation work. 
Edit an answer again cut everything here.

1
00:13.770 --> 00:15.320
Let's open our developer tool

2
00:21.660 --> 00:25.150
and hit the Network tab.

3
00:25.220 --> 00:26.810
Now if we hit the update button

4
00:33.710 --> 00:35.000
we get error message here

5
00:37.890 --> 00:41.150
then we go to a console.

6
00:41.320 --> 00:44.300
We get error unprocessable entity.

7
00:44.360 --> 00:47.920
So basically our server side validation is working fine.

8
00:49.660 --> 00:55.350
But the problem here we need to tell the user what's 
happening in our server. There could be many different

9
00:55.350 --> 01:00.250
ways to show the validation error message 
that's sent from or the server to the client.

10
01:00.600 --> 01:02.850
But for now we're going to use the simple way

11
01:08.060 --> 01:10.380
let's switch back to and answer dot vue

12
01:15.000 --> 01:24.070
and here in `catch` method we can show in the validation 
error message in javascript alert but before that let's

13
01:24.070 --> 01:25.840
see the error response in console log

14
01:46.530 --> 01:54.470
edit an answer cut everything and 
hit update button let's see in console

15
01:57.500 --> 02:06.590
Here we can see that the error message 
placed in data so data message.

16
02:06.670 --> 02:09.960
So here let's show the error message in alert

17
02:21.170 --> 02:23.280
Let's save this and have a look

18
02:32.360 --> 02:38.340
edit an answer clear everything and hit update button.

19
02:39.540 --> 02:48.890
Now the validation error message show up in alert.

20
02:48.970 --> 02:53.890
Now we can also validate the form 
in the client side by utilizing html

21
02:53.890 --> 03:04.960
required attribute in our text area. Let's go to underscore 
answer blade php and then add `required` attribute

22
03:04.960 --> 03:05.530
like so.

23
03:15.560 --> 03:17.250
Now if try to edit again

24
03:20.510 --> 03:26.260
and then clear the answer and then hit update.

25
03:26.380 --> 03:30.370
Here we get a message tells us that this text area is required.

26
03:34.860 --> 03:37.850
and we can also make the update button disabled

27
03:37.900 --> 03:47.390
if the text area is empty or invalid. Here we simply
bind to this button a boolean value to disable

28
03:47.410 --> 04:01.980
attribute.

29
04:02.060 --> 04:08.850
So if we set this to false this button 
will be active. But if we set  this

30
04:08.880 --> 04:12.980
to true this button will be an active.

31
04:13.120 --> 04:18.650
In this case let's make this button disable 
if the character length of the answer's body

32
04:18.700 --> 04:21.130
It's less than 10 characters.

33
04:21.530 --> 04:30.440
Here we say disabled this button if answer is invalid.

34
04:32.990 --> 04:37.820
We'll put the logic in computer property.

35
04:38.050 --> 04:39.970
So let's switch to answer dot vue

36
04:44.220 --> 04:45.590
define a computer property

37
04:53.190 --> 04:54.050
Inside here

38
04:54.100 --> 04:55.250
let's define that method.

39
05:00.680 --> 05:07.090
here is simply turn this body length

40
05:09.850 --> 05:15.060
less than 10 and then add exclamation mark to inverse the result

41
05:17.820 --> 05:24.870
so if the character length or the body is less than 
10 or you can change the number whatever you like

42
05:24.960 --> 05:26.840
this method will return true

43
05:27.210 --> 05:29.810
otherwise it will return false.

44
05:30.160 --> 05:34.640
Let's save and give it a shot one more time.

45
05:36.980 --> 05:41.820
Reload the page.

46
05:41.980 --> 05:46.690
I get the error fn bind is not defined

47
05:47.170 --> 05:58.700
Let me see.

48
05:58.720 --> 06:01.760
Sorry I placed the computed propety in the wrong place.

49
06:06.150 --> 06:10.200
Cut this and paste

50
06:10.510 --> 06:12.220
outside the methods property.

51
06:21.220 --> 06:25.100
save reload the page.

52
06:29.160 --> 06:29.590
OK

53
06:29.640 --> 06:33.160
now I have no error. Let's edit an answer.

54
06:33.690 --> 06:36.650
And no I have the update button inactive

55
06:36.660 --> 06:38.720
I need to fix the is invalid method.

56
06:44.090 --> 06:46.840
Actually this exclamation mark is not needed.

57
06:48.060 --> 06:49.140
So is invalid

58
06:49.140 --> 06:50.210
it will return true

59
06:50.370 --> 06:51.150
if the answer's

60
06:51.150 --> 06:53.040
body length is less than 10.

61
06:53.160 --> 06:57.610
OK save that. And let me try one more time

62
07:00.690 --> 07:02.300
edit an answer.

63
07:03.390 --> 07:05.990
then clear everything.

64
07:06.030 --> 07:08.770
Now you can see the update button inactive.

65
07:08.800 --> 07:12.470
If we type something that more than or equal ten characters.

66
07:12.690 --> 07:14.120
The button will be active

67
07:23.290 --> 07:24.210
OK great.

68
07:24.250 --> 07:29.530
We've created an answer component successfully 
and now our answer UI look more interactive.

69
07:29.560 --> 07:34.870
We don't need to refresh the page to see the changes. 
In the next lesson where are we're going to ajaxifying

70
07:34.900 --> 07:36.270
this delete button

71
07:36.310 --> 07:42.520
So when we delete an answer it don't need
to reload the page to see the change.

72
07:42.580 --> 07:45.550
All right let's take a break and I'll see you in the next lesson.
