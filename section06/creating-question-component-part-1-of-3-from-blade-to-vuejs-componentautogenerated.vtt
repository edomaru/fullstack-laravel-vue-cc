00:01.690 --> 00:08.080
After we have successfully rewritten the answers part 
on this page now it's time to rewrite this question

1
00:08.080 --> 00:10.190
part into vue js component.

2
00:12.150 --> 00:18.180
We'll also need to add additional functionalities so that 
we can update or delete question without need to go

3
00:18.210 --> 00:19.970
to all questions page.

4
00:19.980 --> 00:21.840
All right let's open up our terminal

5
00:24.830 --> 00:31.890
then create new branch git checkout -b lesson 41.

6
00:33.740 --> 00:36.510
And then run way back npm run

7
00:36.770 --> 00:37.180
watch

8
00:44.660 --> 00:45.150
OK.

9
00:45.170 --> 00:49.030
Firstly let's open up show blade php file

10
00:54.390 --> 00:57.120
and here let's fold this row div

11
01:01.370 --> 01:07.730
select then cut and add question 
component that we will create shortly.

12
01:23.920 --> 01:31.690
Now we can go to assets js components and create new file

13
01:34.830 --> 01:50.350
here I'm going to call question dot vue. Here inside 
this file let's add template and paste the code.

14
01:50.580 --> 01:57.180
Since we are in vue file let's make some changes 
or convert the blade syntax to vue js syntax.

15
01:57.210 --> 02:08.170
Firstly let's change the heading's text to title 
and then change the href of this anchor

16
02:11.840 --> 02:13.940
forward slash questions

17
02:20.050 --> 02:29.260
And then here the vote and user info 
components depend on question instance.

18
02:29.330 --> 02:33.030
So let's select the model attribute of both

19
02:33.350 --> 02:34.510
remove the mustaches 

20
02:42.100 --> 02:44.010
and also remove the dollar sign

21
02:47.820 --> 02:53.250
and then let's replace this code with a div

22
02:57.340 --> 03:02.220
v html equals body html.

23
03:05.300 --> 03:06.250
All right

24
03:06.320 --> 03:07.900
now let's end script section

25
03:16.910 --> 03:22.560
then define props property and then add question.

26
03:25.970 --> 03:27.770
Let's also add data method

27
03:30.860 --> 03:31.810
return an object

28
03:35.530 --> 03:37.920
then here let's add some properties

29
03:37.970 --> 03:38.450
title

30
03:41.570 --> 03:42.750
to hold question's title

31
03:48.050 --> 03:55.980
then body to hold question's body

32
03:56.150 --> 04:02.180
And then body html to hold question's body underscore html

33
04:09.150 --> 04:09.470
OK

34
04:09.490 --> 04:10.800
that's it for now.

35
04:10.900 --> 04:15.710
The next thing that we need to do is 
register this component. For now

36
04:15.770 --> 04:17.700
let's register it globally in app

37
04:17.720 --> 04:18.520
dot js

38
04:18.630 --> 04:19.820
So let's open that file

39
04:30.680 --> 04:31.900
duplicate this line

40
04:34.940 --> 04:37.460
and change the name to question

41
04:40.550 --> 04:42.020
and then the file name to

42
04:45.460 --> 04:50.210
question dot vue.

43
04:50.260 --> 04:50.740
All right

44
04:50.740 --> 04:52.520
we have created question component

45
04:52.720 --> 05:00.450
we have registered it globally in this app.js and we have called it in show blade php

46
05:01.240 --> 05:02.780
Now let's save all changes

47
05:07.880 --> 05:08.690
and let's have a look.

48
05:12.360 --> 05:13.110
Reload the page.

49
05:17.010 --> 05:22.620
Ups the question body empty and I'm 
sure you already know what's going on.

50
05:22.620 --> 05:33.520
Before I fix that let me open vue developer tool

51
05:33.760 --> 05:39.680
Now we can see there are two components below 
root component question and answers component.

52
05:41.990 --> 05:42.880
OK

53
05:43.220 --> 05:44.850
Now let's fix this issue.

54
05:45.090 --> 05:47.090
Let's switch over to our editor.

55
05:49.510 --> 05:52.530
And then open question model

56
05:59.420 --> 06:04.210
here in appends attribute let's register the body html accessor.

57
06:12.790 --> 06:13.330
Reload

58
06:16.440 --> 06:16.930
OK

59
06:16.930 --> 06:19.630
now the question body come back.

60
06:19.630 --> 06:21.040
Let me check the vote controls

61
06:35.210 --> 06:35.740
OK

62
06:35.760 --> 06:37.360
everything seems good.
