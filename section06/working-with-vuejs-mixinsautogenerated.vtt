00:02.400 --> 00:06.290
In this lesson we're gonna be using something called mixins.

1
00:06.580 --> 00:12.640
If you read in vue js official guide mixins are a 
flexible way to distribute reusable functionalities

2
00:12.880 --> 00:19.210
for vue components and mixin object can contain any 
component options when a component uses a mixin

3
00:19.560 --> 00:24.370
all options in the mixing will be mixed 
into components own options.

4
00:24.370 --> 00:31.090
So in the simple term I can say that mixins allows you 
to share some functionalities across components

5
00:31.210 --> 00:33.350
throughout the application.

6
00:33.500 --> 00:42.470
Alright let's open up our terminal and then 
create new branch git checkout -b lesson

7
00:42.530 --> 00:45.760
42.

8
00:45.930 --> 00:47.570
Then let's also run web pack

9
00:47.590 --> 00:49.360
by saying npm run

10
00:49.410 --> 00:49.830
watch

11
00:54.240 --> 01:00.940
Okay now let's go to assets js folder 
and then let's create new folder

12
01:04.140 --> 01:10.290
and let's call it mixins inside this folder

13
01:10.380 --> 01:11.360
let's create new file

14
01:14.520 --> 01:14.820
here

15
01:14.820 --> 01:16.330
I'm gonna call it

16
01:16.560 --> 01:17.280
I don't know

17
01:17.280 --> 01:22.390
I have no idea I just call it modification dot

18
01:22.600 --> 01:26.540
js of course you can call it whatever you like. In here

19
01:26.540 --> 01:37.470
let's create javascript module to export 
object by saying export default

20
01:37.510 --> 01:40.300
now we can open the question and answer

21
01:40.300 --> 01:47.890
side by side so that we can easily analyze the 
duplicates or similar code and put them in our mixin

22
02:08.680 --> 02:17.340
here in data method we can see the editing 
property both in answer and question.

23
02:17.340 --> 02:25.430
So let's copy these here in a modification 
dot js let's define the data method.

24
02:27.910 --> 02:31.000
return an object and paste the editing

25
02:36.520 --> 02:42.180
here we cannot put the body and body html 
in our mixin because they are different

26
02:53.240 --> 03:02.760
here in computer property we will find is invalid and 
endpoint in both answer and question but their

27
03:02.760 --> 03:05.320
implementation a bit different.

28
03:05.320 --> 03:06.790
So here we don't need to touch them

29
03:16.700 --> 03:19.110
next here in methods property

30
03:19.130 --> 03:26.900
we have similar functionalities in edit and cancel methods 
both methods in both component has to modify

31
03:27.350 --> 03:29.270
the editing property.

32
03:29.270 --> 03:32.990
In my opinion we can define both method in our mixin

33
03:46.520 --> 03:51.170
but since the setter and getter code in both places are different

34
03:55.160 --> 03:59.150
so here we can encapsulate them in other methods

35
04:05.020 --> 04:08.800
let's say set edit cache

36
04:13.600 --> 04:14.270
and then here

37
04:19.190 --> 04:23.900
let's say restore from cache

38
04:27.340 --> 04:31.240
so in each component we need to define both

39
04:31.360 --> 04:38.730
edit cache and restore from cache or we can also 
define both methods here as empty method like this

40
04:53.270 --> 04:54.900
letter in the component

41
04:54.970 --> 05:07.680
where we include the mixin we need to override these 
methods or implement their actual functionalities.

42
05:07.920 --> 05:08.790
Okay next

43
05:08.890 --> 05:14.770
let's also copy this update method into our mixin

44
05:15.070 --> 05:20.160
Note that the different in this part is this payload

45
05:32.170 --> 05:43.380
so here we can replace this with this dot payload that 
means in a component we only need to define the payload

46
05:43.380 --> 05:46.320
method and specify what data to be sent

47
05:50.660 --> 05:51.380
or again

48
05:51.380 --> 05:57.440
here we can define the payload method in our mixin 
as empty method so that we know that we will need to

49
05:57.540 --> 06:14.440
override this method in the component but this is not necessary.

50
06:14.960 --> 06:17.930
Let's also copy the destroy method into our mixin

51
06:32.640 --> 06:37.790
note that the different part in this method is the code in yes button

52
06:44.550 --> 06:47.760
so let's replace these with

53
06:51.170 --> 06:52.270
this dot delete

54
06:55.820 --> 07:02.060
outside the destroy method we can define
the delete method as empty method.

55
07:05.510 --> 07:11.510
Again this is not necessary. But I think it will helps us 
to know which method that we need to redefine in

56
07:11.750 --> 07:15.650
the component where we include our mixin. All right

57
07:15.770 --> 07:18.620
now let's include our mixing in the answer dot vue

58
07:27.070 --> 07:29.410
firstly let's import the mixin in here

59
07:47.620 --> 07:58.880
then here we can add mixins which accepts an array 
and we can add the modification mixin inside

60
07:58.880 --> 07:59.020
it

61
08:04.250 --> 08:07.910
then here in data we can remove the editing property

62
08:11.200 --> 08:13.660
because we've defined it in our mixin

63
08:17.710 --> 08:19.770
now inside this methods property

64
08:19.810 --> 08:23.080
let's redefine some methods and remove some.

65
08:23.110 --> 08:26.040
Here we have defined the edit in our mixin

66
08:26.470 --> 08:31.230
what we need to do is to redefine the set edit cache.

67
08:31.370 --> 08:34.040
Here we can simply change the edit method

68
08:35.650 --> 08:38.140
to set edit cache

69
08:41.200 --> 08:53.320
here we can keep this line and remove this line.
Let's also change this cancel method to restore from

70
08:53.330 --> 08:59.110
cache keep this line and remove this line.

71
09:02.060 --> 09:02.700
Next

72
09:02.720 --> 09:07.250
here we have defined the update method 
in our mixin all we have to do here

73
09:07.890 --> 09:08.850
Is to cut this code

74
09:12.000 --> 09:13.190
remove this update method

75
09:16.820 --> 09:18.670
then redefine the payload method.

76
09:26.280 --> 09:32.340
Inside this method let's add return 
statement and paste the previous code.

77
09:36.280 --> 09:37.250
Next

78
09:37.420 --> 09:39.940
let's cut these axios dot delete

79
09:42.940 --> 09:44.180
remove the destroy method

80
09:49.000 --> 09:50.710
and redefine the delete method.

81
09:54.370 --> 09:56.470
Inside this method just paste the previous code.

82
10:01.840 --> 10:07.540
One thing that I missed here is to show 
the success message after deletion.

83
10:07.540 --> 10:12.890
So let me copy from here and then paste here.

84
10:17.620 --> 10:17.910
All right

85
10:18.300 --> 10:19.980
I think that's all we need.

86
10:19.990 --> 10:32.370
Let's give it a safe and let's make sure that 
everything's still working just fine.

87
10:32.400 --> 10:39.170
Let me randomly select a question.

88
10:39.230 --> 10:46.370
Now let's open our browser console and 
make sure we don't have any errors. Okay

89
10:46.430 --> 10:47.250
I have no errors.

90
10:50.560 --> 10:52.270
Now let's edit any random answer.

91
10:59.490 --> 11:00.660
Modify something here

92
11:03.130 --> 11:05.980
then let's hit the cancel button to undo the change

93
11:09.450 --> 11:16.970
let's hit the edit button again and 
make sure the content's not change.

94
11:16.990 --> 11:18.580
Now let's modify the answer.

95
11:26.910 --> 11:29.070
Then hit the update button to save the changes

96
11:35.620 --> 11:38.890
let me reload the page to make sure the changes is persistence.

97
11:43.260 --> 11:45.380
OK so far so good.

98
11:45.430 --> 11:47.190
Last let's remove the answer.

99
11:54.990 --> 11:56.170
Something went wrong.

100
11:56.220 --> 11:57.840
Let me reopen my browser console

101
12:01.180 --> 12:02.950
here I have error data

102
12:02.950 --> 12:06.380
is not defined. Let me see

103
12:10.400 --> 12:12.670
OK here I have res in argument

104
12:13.960 --> 12:22.690
So here I need to call res dot data.

105
12:22.730 --> 12:25.160
I'm sure this answer has been removed.

106
12:25.340 --> 12:26.420
So let me reload the page.

107
12:32.090 --> 12:32.780
Then here

108
12:32.780 --> 12:34.790
let me try to remove another answer.

109
12:38.920 --> 12:42.560
Hit yes. OK great

110
12:45.380 --> 12:48.370
now we can do the same thing to question component.

111
12:48.550 --> 12:50.330
Let's switch back over to our editor

112
12:57.210 --> 12:58.710
here in question component

113
13:01.450 --> 13:03.940
firstly let's import our modification mixin

114
13:14.210 --> 13:18.110
then here let's add the mixins property

115
13:22.010 --> 13:25.070
and then add the modification mixin inside the array

116
13:30.030 --> 13:33.330
then here in data method let's remove the editing property

117
13:37.590 --> 13:40.060
we don't need to touch the computed property

118
13:40.110 --> 13:45.210
Just keep that next inside the methods property

119
13:45.230 --> 13:55.510
we can change the edit to set edit cache. 
Keep these lines and remove the rest.

120
13:57.260 --> 14:00.380
Then here we can replace the cancel method

121
14:02.300 --> 14:18.810
to restore from cache. Keep these lines and remove 
this line. Here inside the update method let's cut the

122
14:18.810 --> 14:19.470
payload part

123
14:23.520 --> 14:24.260
remove the method

124
14:27.260 --> 14:30.370
then redefine or override the payload method

125
14:34.980 --> 14:35.880
inside this method

126
14:36.180 --> 14:39.480
let's add return statement and paste the payload.

127
14:43.480 --> 14:44.760
Last inside

128
14:44.800 --> 14:45.850
the destroy method

129
14:46.420 --> 14:51.030
let's cut the axios dot delete and set time out.

130
14:54.920 --> 14:55.990
Remove the method

131
14:58.710 --> 15:01.240
and then redefine the delete method.

132
15:04.310 --> 15:06.780
Inside this method just paste the previous code.

133
15:12.400 --> 15:12.990
Alright

134
15:13.100 --> 15:16.190
let's give it a safe and let's make sure that we have an error.

135
15:22.560 --> 15:23.340
Reload the page.

136
15:27.750 --> 15:32.930
Let's open our browser console. Great we have no errors.

137
15:36.040 --> 15:37.540
Now let's edit the question

138
15:41.240 --> 15:42.320
let's make changes here

139
15:52.140 --> 15:54.510
and hit the cancel button to undo the change

140
15:58.580 --> 16:05.660
let's hit the edit button again and make sure the content is not change okay.

141
16:05.830 --> 16:07.880
No let's make changes one more time.

142
16:15.980 --> 16:27.750
And then hit the update button to 
save the changes to our database.

143
16:27.820 --> 16:28.610
Okay great.

144
16:31.060 --> 16:38.680
We've successfully DRY our script by utilizing 
view mixins and now our code look more clean.

145
16:38.700 --> 16:42.900
All right let's end this lesson and save 
all files changes to our git repo.
