Laravel has release cycle every six months

1
00:04.940 --> 00:08.840
probably in a year there would be two versions release.

2
00:08.930 --> 00:15.780
So to keep our application up to date we need to 
upgrade our larval app once new version released.

3
00:15.890 --> 00:22.280
But upgrading level up manually is not easy because 
we need to update the laraval framework with its

4
00:22.280 --> 00:23.540
dependencies

5
00:23.570 --> 00:25.250
to the newer version.

6
00:25.250 --> 00:31.690
If we are using third party dependencies then we need 
to update them where the newest frameworks support.

7
00:31.700 --> 00:35.640
We also need to make some changes 
to our core application structure,

8
00:35.900 --> 00:41.000
adding new files or install additional third 
party packages to fit the new framework.

9
00:43.640 --> 00:51.570
So an alternative way is to use third party services 
called laravel shift you can visit the homepage

10
00:51.600 --> 00:55.820
by accessing laravelshift.com.

11
00:55.840 --> 01:06.190
Here we can see that this service able to update from 
laravel version 4.2 to 5.8 which the current version

12
01:06.340 --> 01:07.690
when I'm recording this video

13
01:12.090 --> 01:17.420
it's not free but the price that they offer is not much expensive.

14
01:17.420 --> 01:21.110
You can pay from three to twenty nine dollar.

15
01:21.110 --> 01:28.760
You can see more detail about the price by hitting this link.

16
01:28.940 --> 01:41.220
For example you can update larval version 
from 5.7 to 5.8 for $9. Laravel 5.6 to 5.7

17
01:41.240 --> 01:44.900
$13 and so on.

18
01:44.900 --> 01:50.750
So if you don't have time to manually upgrade your app 
then you can try this service but if you don't want

19
01:50.750 --> 01:55.650
to spend some money or other reasons 
then you need to upgrade manually.

20
01:55.850 --> 02:00.090
And in this section I'm going to show you how 
to upgrade laravel application manually.

21
02:02.960 --> 02:07.320
when firstly recording this course I was using Laravel 5.6.

22
02:07.320 --> 02:17.570
So in this section I'll provide how to upgrade 
laravel from Version 5.6 to 5.7 and 5.7 to 5.8

23
02:17.570 --> 02:23.680
and I'll do my best to add new upgrade 
guide when new laravel version release.

24
02:23.790 --> 02:26.560
You don't need to follow all lessons in this section

25
02:26.640 --> 02:31.440
just follow the upgrade guide based on 
which level version you are using.

26
02:31.440 --> 02:38.310
For example if you're using version 5.7 when follow 
this course then you can follow upgrade guide

27
02:38.640 --> 02:45.690
for Level 5.8 or if you're using laravel 
5.8 and new version released

28
02:45.750 --> 02:51.540
then you can come back here and hopefully I've been 
provided the upgrade guide for the newer version.

29
02:53.080 --> 02:59.900
Now before following the upgrade guide please 
check the server requirements in laravel official

30
02:59.900 --> 03:07.040
documentation and make sure all the requirements 
on your server are met so that your app still work

31
03:07.070 --> 03:11.420
properly after upgrade finished. When your server ready

32
03:11.440 --> 03:13.880
You can then follow the guide based on your need.

33
03:14.830 --> 03:16.050
OK let's get started.
