In this lesson we are gonna be looking at how to 
upgrade Laravel app from version five point eight

1
00:06.490 --> 00:10.020
to 6.0 LTS.

2
00:10.060 --> 00:15.900
Note that there's no version 5.9 as you could predicted before.

3
00:15.940 --> 00:19.850
So here I have read everything in this page

4
00:20.080 --> 00:21.010
and I think

5
00:21.010 --> 00:28.850
what we need to care about regarding to our 
Laravel Q/A app are only two things. Upgrade

6
00:28.930 --> 00:33.110
Laravel framework dependency as well as third party library.

7
00:33.190 --> 00:37.040
And update email verification in our core application.

8
00:37.300 --> 00:43.180
After we've done that we'll be using Github comparison 
tool to see other file changes and then apply

9
00:43.210 --> 00:46.760
that to our core applications file.

10
00:46.900 --> 00:54.370
Also note that before you decide to upgrade to Laravel 
version 6 you need to upgrade your PHP version

11
00:54.700 --> 00:57.830
to 7.2 or higher.

12
00:57.830 --> 01:04.180
And I think you should do that just in case 
you're still using PHP version 7.1 because if

13
01:04.180 --> 01:08.740
you see here PHP 7.1 will no longer be actively maintenance

14
01:08.890 --> 01:11.180
as of December 2019.

15
01:13.880 --> 01:14.840
Here I'm using

16
01:17.600 --> 01:19.290
PHP 7.3

17
01:19.490 --> 01:21.800
so I got to go.

18
01:21.830 --> 01:25.180
All right let's change the working directory to our Laravel app

19
01:35.000 --> 01:35.530
here

20
01:35.560 --> 01:45.950
let me check my level version by saying: php 
artisan --version my current level version is five

21
01:45.950 --> 01:50.090
point eight point twenty three.

22
01:50.300 --> 01:50.650
All right

23
01:50.690 --> 01:56.720
as always before we upgrade to the newer version 
let's create a new branch to isolate all changes

24
01:56.900 --> 02:00.110
that we will make: git checkout

25
02:00.200 --> 02:01.750
-b

26
02:02.330 --> 02:09.040
and here I'm gonna call laravel-v6.0

27
02:09.040 --> 02:12.730
OK

28
02:12.800 --> 02:17.220
let's go back to our browser, and here

29
02:17.240 --> 02:25.380
the first thing that we need to do is update our Laravel 
framework dependency to version 6.0 in our composer

30
02:25.380 --> 02:27.710
dot json

31
02:27.900 --> 02:32.620
Also we need to examine any third party 
packages that consumed by our app.

32
02:34.110 --> 02:37.590
So to do that let's scroll all the way down

33
02:43.110 --> 02:45.630
then hit this GitHub comparison tool

34
02:52.760 --> 02:54.930
hit the file changes

35
02:55.150 --> 03:04.910
make sure you hit this split mode and 
then let's find composer.json. Okay

36
03:04.910 --> 03:05.890
there we go.

37
03:06.780 --> 03:14.790
So here we need to change our php version from 
seven point one point three to seven point two.

38
03:14.790 --> 03:23.100
Then we need to change laravel framework from five 
point eight to six point o. In require dev section

39
03:23.100 --> 03:26.030
we see that these packages are no longer needed.

40
03:26.340 --> 03:32.970
They replaced with this new package facade ignition 
which is the new and better error page for Laravel

41
03:37.150 --> 03:38.950
and here for php unit

42
03:38.950 --> 03:44.410
we need to change from from 7.5 to 8.0.

43
03:44.830 --> 03:56.770
So let's go back to our editor. Let's pull open the composer.json, go to require section. And here

44
03:56.770 --> 03:59.890
let's change this to seven point two

45
04:05.350 --> 04:10.980
then change this version to six point 0.

46
04:11.300 --> 04:18.960
here we have a couple of third body packages such 
as doctrine, Laravel nexmo notification channel,

47
04:19.210 --> 04:23.750
laravel slack notification channel and purifier.

48
04:23.750 --> 04:28.790
I have checked all of these and I'm sure 
they are compatible with Level 6.0.

49
04:29.690 --> 04:36.140
So just in case you're using other library then make 
sure it's compatible with the newer version of

50
04:36.140 --> 04:37.620
Laravel.

51
04:37.640 --> 04:40.920
All right, let's go back to our browser

52
04:40.970 --> 04:42.940
let me copy this line

53
04:45.620 --> 04:46.520
back to the editor. I'll move

54
04:50.000 --> 04:59.550
this up and I'll select these lines and replace with this line.

55
04:59.550 --> 05:03.230
Don't forget the comma here. Also

56
05:03.410 --> 05:11.470
I'll change this php unit to 8.0. Alright

57
05:11.520 --> 05:22.320
let's save this changes, go to our terminal and type: 
composer update and hopefully we'll not get into any

58
05:22.320 --> 05:23.770
error.

59
05:25.380 --> 05:26.550
While it's updating

60
05:26.550 --> 05:27.930
let's go back to the upgrade guide

61
05:34.650 --> 05:44.520
let's jump to e-mail verification.

62
05:44.610 --> 05:45.050
Here we go

63
05:49.920 --> 05:55.860
so here to prevent possible csrf attack e-mail 
verification has been updated from a get route

64
05:55.860 --> 05:59.920
to a post. So let's copy this lines.

65
06:03.150 --> 06:10.980
Head back to our editor then open verify blade php

66
06:14.490 --> 06:16.440
here let's select both of these lines,

67
06:19.430 --> 06:20.160
and paste the code.

68
06:25.230 --> 06:32.530
Let's indent a little bit. 

69
06:32.530 --> 06:32.860
All right

70
06:32.870 --> 06:34.160
let me check my terminal

71
06:37.160 --> 06:38.670
I get a bunch of errors here

72
06:45.950 --> 06:54.220
it looks like this ever happened on purifier. Let me 
go back to my editor and see the composer.json

73
06:54.220 --> 07:08.640
OK here I forgot to change the purifier version 
to version 3.0. Let's save this, back to my

74
07:08.640 --> 07:09.240
terminal

75
07:14.140 --> 07:17.340
and here I'll rerun composer update.

76
07:19.360 --> 07:20.890
While it's doing its things

77
07:20.950 --> 07:28.300
let's head back over to our browser and yeah I 
think that's all we need to follow from this page.

78
07:28.360 --> 07:34.450
And now let's switch to github comparison tool to see other 
file changes and apply them in our core application.

79
07:40.730 --> 07:41.230
Now

80
07:41.390 --> 07:46.670
while I'm doing this thing I'm not talking anything 
and I'll fast forward the video to save the time

81
09:44.630 --> 09:46.080
All right let's save  all changes.

82
09:47.410 --> 09:52.060
And let's go back to our terminal. Here we have no error

83
09:52.220 --> 09:58.120
that means Laravel framework dependency as 
well as temporary library successfully updated.

84
09:58.130 --> 10:03.790
Now let's make some taste to make sure that 
our application is still working just fine.

85
10:40.590 --> 10:41.400
Okay great

86
10:41.400 --> 10:44.860
our application still working just fine as before.

87
10:44.880 --> 10:47.010
And with that let's go to our terminal

88
10:50.190 --> 10:50.940
kill the server

89
10:55.370 --> 11:09.600
and commit all changes into our git repo: git add all, 
git commit -m update to laravel version

90
11:09.660 --> 11:10.710
six point o

91
11:14.550 --> 11:16.620
git checkout master

92
11:20.690 --> 11:33.840
git merge laravel dash v six point o. Now let's 
push to our remote repo by saying git push

93
11:33.960 --> 11:35.510
origin master

94
11:43.470 --> 11:50.490
and then git push origin laravel version six point o

95
11:58.200 --> 11:58.730
okay congratulation,

96
11:59.800 --> 12:05.530
now your application updated to laravel version 6.0 
and you keep your application up to date.
