00:01.700 --> 00:08.840
In this lesson I'm going to show you how to upgrade 
laravel Q/A app from Version 5.6 to version

1
00:09.020 --> 00:16.630
5.7 and here I've already open the upgrade 
guide from laravel official documentation as

2
00:16.630 --> 00:23.790
reference. Now before we're moving on here I'm going 
to show you two different ways that you can follow

3
00:23.970 --> 00:26.640
when upgrading your laravel application.

4
00:26.640 --> 00:35.220
So the first one is you read and follow every 
step from the top all the way down.

5
00:35.340 --> 00:40.550
Then the second one is you go to button open this

6
00:40.560 --> 00:41.780
Github comparison tool

7
00:50.910 --> 00:52.010
hit file changes

8
00:55.540 --> 00:57.550
and you can compare the changes

9
00:57.550 --> 00:58.270
side by side.

10
01:06.030 --> 01:11.890
In this video we'll be using the first and second ways 
together because by using this way we will know

11
01:11.980 --> 01:17.620
what changes that we need and don't need to apply 
in our app and how those changes impact our app

12
01:20.790 --> 01:26.600
as you see here.

13
01:26.640 --> 01:33.000
Now some changes that's not required could be not covered 
in this upgrade guide but to make our application's

14
01:33.000 --> 01:41.520
files in sync maybe not all files just certain files so 
we'll go to Github comparison tool and compare

15
01:41.580 --> 01:42.570
some file changes.

16
01:45.170 --> 01:47.810
Okay to start off let's open up our terminal

17
01:50.380 --> 01:52.700
change the working directory to our laravel app

18
01:56.150 --> 02:03.020
here on my Mac I cd to workspace laravel laravel

19
02:03.040 --> 02:10.440
dash qa and as always let's isolate our work today into new branch.

20
02:10.480 --> 02:17.140
So just in case we are getting unwanted error after upgrade we can always revert back to a previous version.

21
02:21.480 --> 02:21.980
Here

22
02:21.990 --> 02:25.140
I'm going to call it laravel

23
02:25.140 --> 02:32.850
dash v five point seven.

24
02:33.040 --> 02:36.880
Let's go back to our browser back to upgrade guide

25
02:45.410 --> 02:45.770
and here

26
02:45.770 --> 02:51.620
the first thing that we need to do is to update our 
dependencies or packages that needed by laravel

27
02:52.370 --> 03:00.850
and the most important is laravel framework package 
and we can do that by specify this version in

28
03:00.850 --> 03:05.850
our composer.json file.

29
03:05.850 --> 03:11.850
Currently we are not using a level passport so we can 
ignore this. But just in case you're using it you

30
03:11.850 --> 03:17.380
also need to upgrade  to version 7.0

31
03:17.940 --> 03:24.360
Also we need to update the third party packages that 
consumed by our app so that they can properly work

32
03:24.360 --> 03:27.630
after updating. To do this

33
03:29.020 --> 03:31.030
let's go to comparison tool

34
03:34.950 --> 03:43.560
and then find composer.json

35
03:43.620 --> 03:44.170
There we go

36
03:47.800 --> 03:49.660
and here we can compare the changes

37
03:49.660 --> 03:51.440
side by side.

38
03:51.440 --> 04:01.600
But the most important here are require and require 
dev sections. In require section we only need to

39
04:01.660 --> 04:07.710
change the laravel framework from 5.6 to 5.7

40
04:08.770 --> 04:11.110
So let's do that in our project

41
04:21.820 --> 04:24.800
let's open composer.json

42
04:31.500 --> 04:37.870
and change this to five point seven back to our browser

43
04:41.930 --> 04:47.970
And here in Level 5.7 we will find new 
package added in require dev section.

44
04:48.360 --> 04:51.930
As you can see in the previous section it doesn't exist yet

45
04:52.830 --> 04:53.880
so let's copy this

46
04:58.960 --> 05:04.030
back to our editor and paste in this require dev.

47
05:06.880 --> 05:14.970
Here we have third party package called laravel debug bar 
and currently when I recorded this video it has three

48
05:14.970 --> 05:16.340
point two version.

49
05:16.390 --> 05:23.760
So let's also change this to three point two. All right

50
05:23.790 --> 05:28.470
let's save the change back to our terminal

51
05:32.770 --> 05:44.500
and type 'composer update' to update our dependencies 
now while updating we can update our core application.

52
05:44.500 --> 05:49.190
So let's go back to our browser back to laravel guide

53
05:54.560 --> 05:56.680
here in application section

54
05:56.780 --> 06:06.530
we can skip this register method because 
we did not override the register method.

55
06:06.620 --> 06:15.500
Now we can go to artisan and we can also skip this 
because we're not using this scheduled job method.

56
06:20.590 --> 06:23.310
Let's continue to assets. And here

57
06:23.350 --> 06:25.780
there is a little bit change in assets directory

58
06:28.650 --> 06:36.010
the assets rectory that contains the script and styles 
has been flattened into the resources directory.

59
06:36.010 --> 06:42.600
So there's no more assets directory the js and 
sass directory are inside resources directory.

60
06:42.820 --> 06:48.050
But as noted here that these changes 
will not affect existing application.

61
06:48.400 --> 06:52.440
You can keep the assets directory as 
it was or you can follow this guide

62
06:52.540 --> 06:53.440
It doesn't matter.

63
06:53.470 --> 06:54.820
I prefer to follow this guide.

64
06:55.690 --> 06:57.190
So let's go back to our editor.

65
07:05.090 --> 07:06.340
Here I'll move

66
07:06.690 --> 07:10.010
this js directory beneath resource

67
07:18.600 --> 07:21.360
and then I'll do the same thing to sass directory

68
07:33.620 --> 07:35.280
and now I can remove this directory

69
07:42.270 --> 07:42.870
Now since the

70
07:42.980 --> 07:43.500
js

71
07:43.530 --> 07:45.540
and sass path has been changed.

72
07:45.540 --> 07:50.520
I also need to adjust the path in web
pack mix js. So let's open that file

73
08:00.320 --> 08:05.390
and here I'll change this from resources assets

74
08:05.510 --> 08:05.920
js

75
08:05.930 --> 08:07.670
app dot js to

76
08:10.600 --> 08:24.410
resource js app dot js and also change this from 
resource asset sass to resource sass app dot scss

77
08:25.860 --> 08:26.730
and that's it.

78
08:26.760 --> 08:35.200
I don't need to touch this prismjs path. 
Okay let's safe, back to our browser

79
08:39.760 --> 08:40.740
and here

80
08:40.750 --> 08:45.920
Level 5.7 has svg directory added in public directory.

81
08:46.260 --> 08:54.150
It contains four SVG files 403, 404, 500 and

82
08:54.170 --> 08:59.780
503 which are displayed on their respective error pages.

83
08:59.970 --> 09:02.040
We can go to this link let's

84
09:12.720 --> 09:14.070
download entire repo

85
09:16.920 --> 09:19.510
hit clone or download and hit

86
09:19.530 --> 09:20.050
download zip

87
09:24.190 --> 09:25.630
I'll open the zip file

88
09:36.500 --> 09:42.500
go to public directory and here let's copy this svg directory.

89
09:48.480 --> 09:50.800
Let's navigate to laravel app

90
10:01.300 --> 10:01.940
paste here

91
10:06.270 --> 10:06.780
all right

92
10:06.780 --> 10:10.990
let's go back to our browser switch to a laravel guide.

93
10:15.770 --> 10:22.010
And here we can skip this authentication because 
we didn't override the method that mentioned here.

94
10:31.180 --> 10:33.490
So let's continue to authorization

95
10:40.750 --> 10:46.280
so if your are implementing this interface you 
should add this method to your implementation.

96
10:46.360 --> 10:52.110
We did not implement this interface so we can skip this.

97
10:52.200 --> 10:56.380
Also we can skip this login event because

98
10:56.460 --> 10:57.200
we are not using it

99
11:01.070 --> 11:02.970
Okay let's see in blade section.

100
11:03.230 --> 11:09.690
The or operator likelihood of impact is high

101
11:09.940 --> 11:16.240
I'm sure I'm not using this operators so far, but just 
in case you use this operator make sure to change

102
11:16.810 --> 11:21.000
from or to double question marks.

103
11:21.310 --> 11:22.810
Ok let's see in cash section

104
11:26.060 --> 11:35.300
likelihood of impact is very high here we need to add data directory in storage framework cache of our

105
11:35.300 --> 11:43.250
app we can do that by simply copy these command head over to our terminal

106
11:47.330 --> 11:57.170
press a command and hit return now just in case the company stop work you can simply go to your editor

107
11:58.730 --> 12:12.140
navigate to storage framework cache and here you can create the data directory back to our browser

108
12:17.450 --> 12:22.850
and here we need to add the get ignore file inside the newly created data directory

109
12:26.590 --> 12:29.810
we can do that by simply copy this command.

110
12:30.340 --> 12:43.200
So this command is instruction to copy the giving or file from cache directory to cache data.

111
12:43.350 --> 12:51.400
OK let's go to our terminal pest command and hit return.

112
12:52.170 --> 12:58.470
If you're using Windows this command might be not working but don't worry you can go to your editor

113
12:59.730 --> 13:08.680
copy the get ignore from here and paste here and here.

114
13:08.760 --> 13:11.910
Let's open the gate ignore inside cache directory

115
13:14.970 --> 13:25.520
and here we can add exclamation mark data or a slash that's noted here

116
13:30.500 --> 13:34.140
right for carbon collection

117
13:38.090 --> 13:46.130
and cookie we can skip all of these now for database I think we can all skip all of these

118
13:49.130 --> 13:49.700
except

119
13:54.990 --> 14:03.760
this one if you're using SQL Server as your database make sure you read this guide and if you're using

120
14:03.760 --> 14:07.110
a single light in your database you need to read this guide

121
14:10.730 --> 14:12.440
we can skip this debug section

122
14:15.140 --> 14:26.870
as well as Quinn.

123
14:26.970 --> 14:35.490
Now let's see the email verification likelihood of impact is optional that means we can add this feature

124
14:36.060 --> 14:42.380
or ignore it will not affect our app but I think this feature is very cool so let's follow this game

125
14:48.450 --> 14:56.080
first we need to add verification controller in app to be control or else directory of our app.

126
14:56.340 --> 15:02.660
So let's go to our flight explorer guilds our level 5 1 7 directory

127
15:06.740 --> 15:14.830
then navigate to app it be controller.

128
15:15.690 --> 15:18.080
Let's copy this for controller file

129
15:29.150 --> 15:29.450
okay.

130
15:29.480 --> 15:39.240
Let's switch back over to our browser and here we did modify our app user model to implement must verify

131
15:39.260 --> 15:48.610
email contract let's copy this line back to our editor open the user model

132
15:53.010 --> 15:54.950
as they come in here.

133
15:59.980 --> 16:13.180
And here after all the cable let's Ed implement must verify email make the wrestler

134
16:21.320 --> 16:30.920
and we need to define verified middleware in route middleware property of our up to the kernel.

135
16:31.160 --> 16:34.790
By doing this way we can verify that only verify the user.

136
16:34.790 --> 16:35.970
My ex isn't even real.

137
16:37.460 --> 16:43.590
So let's copy this line head over to our editor.

138
16:44.420 --> 16:47.540
Open kernel PSP

139
16:53.520 --> 16:54.470
and paste here

140
16:58.520 --> 16:59.010
OK.

141
16:59.020 --> 17:00.010
Victor Bressler

142
17:04.920 --> 17:13.680
and here we need to add new view called verify led BSB inside resources we use of directory.

143
17:13.860 --> 17:14.790
Let's hear this link

144
17:22.990 --> 17:24.190
hit the button.

145
17:27.200 --> 17:45.550
Select all content copy Victor edit editor navigate to seems this views of your file

146
17:48.330 --> 17:58.270
let's call it fortify laid PSP and paste the code pink tor browser.

147
18:06.880 --> 18:13.530
And here the next thing that we need to do is to add email verify at column inside our user stubble

148
18:15.550 --> 18:21.110
so let's cover this line back to our editor.

149
18:22.870 --> 18:26.000
And here you can go to migrations

150
18:32.550 --> 18:34.240
on the create user stable

151
18:39.070 --> 18:42.150
and pays the command here.

152
18:43.130 --> 18:49.700
But by doing this way you need to clean your database and run all migration and you will lose your data.

153
18:49.700 --> 18:54.590
This could be ok since we are in development but imagine you have production ready up.

154
18:54.620 --> 18:56.620
I'm sure you don't need to list your data right.

155
19:00.450 --> 19:02.960
So let's see an alternative way.

156
19:03.120 --> 19:05.700
And before that here I'll under the change

157
19:11.710 --> 19:15.740
let's switch over to our terminal and here.

158
19:15.760 --> 19:30.100
Let's create the immigration file USP or CERN make migration and email verified at in users table

159
19:35.820 --> 19:36.750
Victoria de la

160
19:39.590 --> 19:40.400
open the file

161
19:45.510 --> 19:48.210
here in a method we can pin the code

162
19:52.110 --> 19:56.100
in here and done method distribute column

163
20:10.640 --> 20:11.590
that's simple changes

164
20:14.690 --> 20:15.860
in all this run our lives.

165
20:15.850 --> 20:22.080
Migration in our terminal is be part of some migrate

166
20:25.070 --> 20:26.900
all right back to our browser.

167
20:30.970 --> 20:38.940
And here we say in order to send the email when a user is registered you should register following event

168
20:39.310 --> 20:44.130
and listener in your app provider's event service provider

169
20:48.540 --> 20:50.000
so let's copy these lines

170
20:56.130 --> 21:02.760
Victor any Ed open a van service provider

171
21:07.110 --> 21:13.220
paste make to a browser copy this lines.

172
21:15.070 --> 21:18.570
Back to our editor here in listen.

173
21:18.650 --> 21:19.540
That's like overseeing

174
21:22.540 --> 21:23.620
the pace the previous code

175
21:27.740 --> 21:28.080
here.

176
21:28.080 --> 21:30.600
The final step on a silver vacation

177
21:36.280 --> 21:40.300
is specify this verify option in our threads like this.

178
21:41.640 --> 21:47.070
So back to our editor open Web BHP

179
21:52.090 --> 21:54.610
here in route.

180
21:54.900 --> 22:00.880
That's first fly free fly through.

181
22:00.960 --> 22:01.210
OK.

182
22:01.240 --> 22:12.540
Let's have a change let's switch back to our browser and here we can skip this filesystem hashing

183
22:16.180 --> 22:16.920
and male

184
22:19.940 --> 22:21.380
as well as queue

185
22:25.160 --> 22:26.180
and for routing.

186
22:26.280 --> 22:33.350
There is a note rather a method would you see the likelihood of impact is high

187
22:37.010 --> 22:44.270
the rather of method returns a three hour to HDTV status code redirect the permanent ready Rick method

188
22:44.300 --> 22:46.370
has been added to all three.

189
22:46.370 --> 22:47.270
Also there directs

190
22:49.950 --> 22:57.480
so if you were using this method in your app make sure you specify three or two as to the status code

191
22:57.660 --> 23:06.450
in the third argument or you can replace with this permanent redirect method you can skip these at road

192
23:06.450 --> 23:09.210
method.

193
23:09.670 --> 23:14.590
Also this validation because it only tells us about nested religion rules

194
