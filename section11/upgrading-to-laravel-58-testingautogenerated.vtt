After upgrade our core application as 
well as Laravel dependency packages,

1
00:06.540 --> 00:11.660
now let's make some tests to make sure 
that our app is still working properly.

2
00:11.670 --> 00:17.480
Firstly let's head over to our terminal and start up our server.

3
00:17.580 --> 00:23.550
If your server already running then you need to restart your server.

4
00:25.670 --> 00:27.350
Head over to our browser.

5
00:30.850 --> 00:32.200
Then open our application

6
00:39.210 --> 00:40.200
we didn't see any error

7
00:43.260 --> 00:44.850
now let's register a new user

8
01:00.090 --> 01:00.740
All right

9
01:00.770 --> 01:01.730
new user registered

10
01:02.930 --> 01:04.560
let's go to mail trap

11
01:09.750 --> 01:14.840
go to inbox and verify our newly created user

12
01:21.400 --> 01:21.960
okay

13
01:21.990 --> 01:27.930
The user has been successfully verified.

14
01:28.120 --> 01:30.070
Now let's try to create a new question

15
01:40.090 --> 01:41.830
it's good

16
01:41.830 --> 01:43.930
Let's test editing the question

17
01:49.840 --> 01:50.790
delete the question

18
01:54.330 --> 01:57.190
no error so far.

19
01:57.240 --> 01:58.740
Let's see the question details

20
02:01.630 --> 02:02.740
then create new answer

21
02:18.000 --> 02:18.970
update the answer

22
02:25.750 --> 02:26.680
and delete the answer.

23
02:35.320 --> 02:39.740
Favourite this question, unfavourite,

24
02:41.900 --> 02:43.140
vote up the question,

25
02:52.320 --> 02:56.120
vote up the answer. OK

26
02:56.140 --> 02:56.830
so far so good.

27
03:01.630 --> 03:03.280
Let's log out from application

28
03:09.170 --> 03:14.050
hit log in then hit forgot your password link.

29
03:17.170 --> 03:29.460
Enter email and hit send password reset link.

30
03:29.570 --> 03:30.860
Now let's see our inbox

31
03:35.350 --> 03:35.680

32
03:35.680 --> 03:38.950
I got reset password e-mail. Hit this button

33
03:42.790 --> 03:43.610

34
03:43.700 --> 03:49.270

35
03:49.360 --> 03:50.810
You'll get error.

36
03:51.010 --> 03:58.790
All you have to do is manually add the port here.

37
03:59.360 --> 04:10.840
Now before we update our password let's go back 
to our editor then open auth password reset

38
04:11.340 --> 04:12.130
blade php

39
04:18.380 --> 04:19.030

04:28.670 --> 04:29.240

Let's log out one more time

50
05:05.290 --> 05:15.220
and log in with new password.

51
05:15.430 --> 05:16.310
Okay great.

52
05:16.310 --> 05:22.640
We have successfully upgraded our Laravel app to 
version five point eight and everything is still running

53
05:22.640 --> 05:24.130
properly.

54
05:24.140 --> 05:24.530
All right

55
05:24.800 --> 05:28.580
let's go back to our terminal, kill the server

56
05:32.860 --> 05:33.500
here

57
05:33.520 --> 05:39.730
let's commit all changes to our git repo git add all, git comit

60
05:52.610 --> 05:57.210
checkout master

61
05:57.530 --> 06:08.530
We can merge our master branch to Laravel five point eight git merge laravel dash v 

62
06:08.630 --> 06:10.370
