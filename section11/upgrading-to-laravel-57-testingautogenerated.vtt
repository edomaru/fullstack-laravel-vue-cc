00:02.100 --> 00:09.180
So now that we have upgraded our 
laravel app from version 5.6 to 5.7

1
00:09.340 --> 00:16.300
Now let's make sure that all functionality 
of our app still working properly as before.

2
00:16.320 --> 00:24.630
Firstly let's head over to our terminal and here I've 
successfully updated my dependency packages for

3
00:24.630 --> 00:27.660
my asset.

4
00:27.810 --> 00:34.440
Now I can run npm run dev to make sure 
that compiling asset still working properly

5
00:40.630 --> 00:41.040
Now

6
00:41.090 --> 00:42.410
while it's compiling

7
00:42.410 --> 00:43.400
let's run our server

8
00:54.710 --> 01:01.120
and run php artisan serve back to our browser

9
01:05.240 --> 01:08.420
and open our app. Here

10
01:08.500 --> 01:13.240
I'll reload the page and hopefully we won't find any error

11
01:16.480 --> 01:17.520
OK

12
01:17.540 --> 01:25.060
I have no error and all question still being listed.

13
01:25.180 --> 01:26.500
Now let's create a new question

14
01:32.170 --> 01:33.360
I'll login first

15
01:41.630 --> 01:42.320
here

16
01:42.410 --> 01:43.340
I'll enter title

17
01:48.000 --> 01:49.130
enter question body

18
01:53.940 --> 01:56.500
I'll hit ask question button.

19
01:57.060 --> 01:58.230
Ok new question

20
01:58.230 --> 02:00.630
added. I'll edit this

21
02:04.540 --> 02:06.290
hit update.

22
02:06.640 --> 02:11.300
Now let me delete this question hit

23
02:11.330 --> 02:11.810
OK.

24
02:14.710 --> 02:15.360
OK great.

25
02:17.000 --> 02:18.690
Now I'll see the question details

26
02:22.560 --> 02:25.670
we have blank page here.

27
02:25.710 --> 02:28.400
Let's open our browser console.

28
02:30.220 --> 02:37.440
In here we have failed to mount component 
template or render function not defined.

29
02:37.480 --> 02:39.130
So let's go back to our editor

30
02:42.650 --> 02:44.330
and open app.js

31
02:46.970 --> 02:47.410
So

32
02:47.840 --> 02:56.740
as I said before that when we require the component 
like this we need to chain in with dot default

33
02:58.100 --> 02:58.870
Save

34
02:58.940 --> 03:04.090
and we need to recompile this

35
03:04.100 --> 03:09.860
so here npm run dev

36
03:18.940 --> 03:20.660
Okay let's reload the page

37
03:26.110 --> 03:26.440
Now

38
03:26.440 --> 03:28.440
our answer is come back

39
03:41.820 --> 03:42.410
OK

40
03:42.460 --> 03:45.490
so far so good.

41
03:45.490 --> 03:50.040
Now let's try to register a new user to see how email verification feature work.

42
03:54.010 --> 03:55.630
so let's log out from our app

43
03:59.720 --> 04:00.830
and then hit the register

44
04:13.790 --> 04:23.530
here we'll get error like this because when registered 
new user now it also send email verification.

45
04:23.810 --> 04:29.440
But in order to make it work we need to set 
up the credentials of our email provider.

46
04:30.020 --> 04:31.700
So let's go back to our editor

47
04:35.690 --> 04:38.560
an open .env file

48
04:45.090 --> 04:51.860
as you can see laravel has shipped with mail trap 
email service, but the email and password are

49
04:51.860 --> 04:53.300
still empty.

50
04:53.330 --> 04:59.960
You can also change this configuration with other 
email provider but to make it easy we'll keep using

51
04:59.960 --> 05:01.140
mail trap.

52
05:01.310 --> 05:05.440
So let's go to mail trap home page

53
05:09.640 --> 05:10.430
mailtrap.io

54
05:16.240 --> 05:16.950
and here

55
05:17.020 --> 05:23.590
if you don't have account you can register 
for free by hitting this sign up button.

56
05:24.190 --> 05:29.680
Once you have account you can enter 
inbox name and hit create inbox

57
05:33.160 --> 05:35.830
after that you can go to your inbox

58
05:40.050 --> 05:50.350
then here in SMTP settings you'll find the user and 
password for your inbox. So just copy your username

59
05:50.350 --> 05:54.360
and password and paste in your .env file.

60
06:00.470 --> 06:02.360
Let's save

61
06:02.600 --> 06:03.630
back to our browser

62
06:07.920 --> 06:09.300
and register another user

63
06:15.930 --> 06:21.180
hit register

64
06:21.200 --> 06:22.360
we still get error.

65
06:22.400 --> 06:24.110
Maybe we need to restart our server

66
06:30.440 --> 06:32.510
also clear our config cache

67
06:50.170 --> 06:51.170
enter a new user

68
06:55.950 --> 06:56.740
hit register.

69
07:00.530 --> 07:01.840
Now we have no error.

70
07:02.260 --> 07:04.810
And if we go to our inbox

71
07:07.830 --> 07:11.280
we'll find verify email address.

72
07:11.280 --> 07:16.680
Now before we hit this verify e-mail address 
button let's go back to our application

73
07:20.850 --> 07:24.630
and here you can see new registered user has signed in.

74
07:24.630 --> 07:31.880
Remember this user has not verified his 
account but here he can access this page.

75
07:32.190 --> 07:43.730
Also if we go to all question and hit ask question. Now 
to make sure that certain pages can be accessed

76
07:44.120 --> 07:48.810
only by verified user we need to make a bit change in our routes.

77
07:48.920 --> 07:55.730
So let's go back to our editor open web.php

78
07:59.880 --> 08:11.730
and here we need to protect all routes except the root 
route and then all questions and show question

79
08:11.730 --> 08:16.080
route. So to do that

80
08:16.400 --> 08:20.020
let's define route middleware

81
08:27.920 --> 08:33.380
and then verified and then group

82
08:52.090 --> 08:52.610
here

83
08:52.640 --> 08:55.490
we need to make a little change to this question resource route

84
08:58.490 --> 09:06.440
let's add in this except index. This mean 
show and index route will be exclude.

85
09:16.160 --> 09:20.390
Next we can move this show question outside this scope

86
09:27.770 --> 09:31.430
and lastly let's manually define index route for the question

87
09:52.920 --> 10:03.120
so here there's only four routes that don't need 
the user to verified now let's save back to our app.

88
10:06.550 --> 10:07.230
Here

89
10:07.300 --> 10:08.260
let's reload the page

90
10:12.000 --> 10:13.770
here I get unwanted error

91
10:27.670 --> 10:30.100
class verified does not exist.

92
10:34.320 --> 10:35.400
Sorry I made typo

93
10:39.500 --> 10:41.440
reload the page.

94
10:41.590 --> 10:49.450
Now we'll get this message that tells the user to 
verify the email first before do other thing. Back

95
10:49.460 --> 10:50.110
to mail trap

96
10:52.160 --> 10:53.670
Hit this button

97
10:56.650 --> 10:58.570
the user now has been verified.

98
11:01.920 --> 11:11.310
Let's go back to all questions and hit 
ask question and we still get this error.

99
11:13.600 --> 11:16.530
Let's see our routes again

100
11:20.690 --> 11:26.230
I'm sure this issue is related to routes order.

101
11:26.690 --> 11:28.520
So let's move these

102
11:33.860 --> 11:35.710
on the button.

103
11:35.720 --> 11:41.410
paste, save, reload the page. OK

104
11:41.440 --> 11:41.860
great.

105
11:51.030 --> 11:51.320
OK

106
11:51.320 --> 11:56.160
now the current user able to create new 
question because he has been verified.

107
11:57.230 --> 11:58.520
Okay great

108
11:58.520 --> 12:05.720
now we have our application upgraded to Laravel 
5.7 and all features working just fine. With that

109
12:06.050 --> 12:07.460
let's go back to our terminal

110
12:10.460 --> 12:11.280
kill the server

111
12:15.090 --> 12:15.570
and here

112
12:15.710 --> 12:30.860
let's come our changes git add all, git 
commit -m "upgrade to laravel 5.7"

113
12:34.970 --> 12:36.950
Okay

114
12:37.070 --> 12:44.150
now let's switch to master branch git checkout  master

115
12:45.290 --> 12:51.810
And then before we merge to our upgraded version, 
let's backup this master branch as Laravel

116
12:52.240 --> 12:54.610
5.6 branch

117
12:54.920 --> 13:03.590
git checkout -b laravel-v5.6

118
13:07.510 --> 13:09.380
switch back to master branch git

119
13:09.700 --> 13:12.990
checkout master

120
13:13.750 --> 13:21.440
Now we can merge our master branch with laravel 5.7 git merge

121
13:21.720 --> 13:26.080
laravel dash v

122
13:26.520 --> 13:27.270
five point

123
13:27.370 --> 13:27.850
seven
