00:00.990 --> 00:03.750
All right let's open the Github comparison tool

1
00:08.640 --> 00:10.260
let's jump to the top

2
00:14.610 --> 00:16.950
make sure you hit files changes tab

3
00:21.010 --> 00:29.370
And here in .env.example file we see there 
are four environment variables added that

4
00:29.430 --> 00:33.290
are used to set up Amazon Web Service.

5
00:33.420 --> 00:37.380
Let me select one of them and then find

6
00:40.200 --> 00:42.820
here the variables will be called in

7
00:43.020 --> 00:49.110
dynamodb configuration on config cache.php

8
00:54.750 --> 01:00.990
also in sqs config inside config queue.php

9
01:05.730 --> 01:11.250
and then in ses config inside config services.php

10
01:15.440 --> 01:16.410
So let's copy

11
01:16.400 --> 01:17.130
this lines

12
01:20.450 --> 01:25.220
back to our editor open .env file

13
01:32.730 --> 01:36.260
and paste them in.

14
01:36.360 --> 01:40.350
Now we can hide this file.

15
01:40.350 --> 01:46.440
We don't need this yaml just hide this, also this one.

16
01:50.670 --> 01:53.050
we've already modified this file

17
01:53.220 --> 01:54.210
we can hide this now.

18
01:56.660 --> 02:02.720
Here in trust proxies there is a bit change
just in comment so I'll skip this

19
02:07.500 --> 02:09.380
in auth service provider

20
02:09.450 --> 02:12.540
now the policy mapping is commented out.

21
02:12.810 --> 02:14.480
So let's go back to our editor

22
02:17.700 --> 02:24.110
open auth service provider. Actually

23
02:24.130 --> 02:26.260
we have model policy mappings

24
02:26.260 --> 02:27.910
so we don't need to change this file

25
02:36.800 --> 02:43.670
we've updated our composer.json file so we can skip this.

26
02:45.410 --> 02:58.310
Now in config app.php we'll find two new lines added 
in aliases Arr and Str. Although we have installed

27
02:58.380 --> 03:03.620
laravel helper so that we can still use 
old Laravel array and string helper,

28
03:03.620 --> 03:09.330
but let's add both of these in our app. Let's copy this line

29
03:12.210 --> 03:13.300
back to our editor

30
03:15.890 --> 03:21.830
open config app.php find

31
03:21.910 --> 03:22.810
aliases

32
03:31.150 --> 03:36.340
and paste it here.

33
03:37.180 --> 03:38.480
Let's copy this one

34
03:47.350 --> 03:55.280
and then paste here. OK back to our browser, hide this file.

35
03:58.520 --> 04:03.950
And here in config auth, there is a new line added in api

36
04:04.100 --> 04:15.570
let's copy this line back to our editor, open config auth find api

37
04:18.320 --> 04:19.220
and paste it here.

38
04:27.770 --> 04:32.670
Here in config cache we'll see new configuration added. Here

39
04:32.750 --> 04:33.950
I'll ignore the comment

40
04:34.220 --> 04:36.440
Just copy these lines

41
04:42.150 --> 04:45.110
open config cache

42
04:50.030 --> 04:52.200
and pace the new configuration here.

43
05:00.270 --> 05:02.850
Next let's see the database configuration

44
05:05.570 --> 05:06.700
on the top

45
05:06.800 --> 05:10.490
there import statements to import Str facade.

46
05:10.730 --> 05:18.880
So let's copy this line head over it 
our editor, open config database,

47
05:22.330 --> 05:24.660
paste it here.

48
05:24.660 --> 05:28.510
Back to our browser

49
05:30.190 --> 05:37.180
and here we see URL being added in each database driver.

50
05:37.570 --> 05:40.600
If we open our .env file

51
05:47.920 --> 05:53.140
we don't see the database URL but let's just copy this line.

52
06:17.090 --> 06:17.630
All right

53
06:17.640 --> 06:18.630
back to our browser

54
06:24.120 --> 06:28.600
and here in mysql configuration there's options added

55
06:28.600 --> 06:29.740
so let's copy these.

56
06:41.950 --> 06:43.670
Now in redis

57
06:43.730 --> 06:48.030
there's a bit change in client value and new options added.

58
06:48.490 --> 06:49.900
So let's copy this lines,

59
06:53.730 --> 06:54.910
back to our editor,

60
07:04.920 --> 07:05.330
and here

61
07:05.350 --> 07:14.410
let's replace this line.

62
07:15.490 --> 07:20.090
Also we need to add URL in default and cache

63
07:30.690 --> 07:31.740
back to our browser

64
07:38.310 --> 07:44.070
here we can skip this config mail.

65
07:44.090 --> 07:51.610
And then here in config queue there are 
new line added in let me expand this

66
07:56.510 --> 08:01.900
so there's new line added in beanstalkd. So let's copy this line

67
08:13.050 --> 08:13.890
paste here.

68
08:20.230 --> 08:21.760
Still in the same file

69
08:21.860 --> 08:31.300
there is some update to key, secret 
and region value on sqs configuration.

70
08:31.300 --> 08:32.350
So let's update them

71
08:52.840 --> 08:58.450
and then in config surfaces there's a new config added the postmark

72
09:06.390 --> 09:07.900
so let's copy these lines

73
09:18.600 --> 09:23.980
paste here and then let's copy these lines.

74
09:27.230 --> 09:28.540
Actually we can do that.

75
09:29.450 --> 09:32.150
So let's be copy each one of these

76
09:46.830 --> 09:47.700
now here.

77
09:47.730 --> 09:49.510
That is a big change in the command.

78
09:49.510 --> 09:56.040
Instead this file probably you could do this but for me I'll skip this change

79
10:02.870 --> 10:06.150
than here in database get ignore file.

80
10:06.210 --> 10:17.360
There is a new line added to get ignore a file with extension the SQL light dash journal so let's copy

81
10:17.360 --> 10:17.990
this Len

82
10:21.350 --> 10:24.110
navigate to database trickery

83
10:27.980 --> 10:33.980
then open gate ignore and then paste it here.

84
10:39.580 --> 10:49.440
Next here in user factory there is a little bit changes but the most important is here.

85
10:49.450 --> 10:53.400
The hotspots work because now the minimum password length is eight.

86
10:53.470 --> 10:56.230
So let's copy this value as well as the command

87
11:00.640 --> 11:04.480
picked or any tor open user.

88
11:04.490 --> 11:05.200
Factory

89
11:08.600 --> 11:10.220
here let's replace this line

90
11:18.350 --> 11:19.220
anything.

91
11:19.220 --> 11:20.960
Import the user model in the top

92
11:25.290 --> 11:36.330
and possibly in only the user class is more clean.

93
11:36.360 --> 11:43.370
Now now for these crit users double migration we don't need to change anything.

94
11:43.780 --> 11:51.100
Just keep it in increments because it we change this file to big increment we also need to make change

95
11:51.130 --> 11:58.070
the Frankie column definition in for example great questions that all good answer double etc..

96
12:00.730 --> 12:09.790
Next in package that is on file will update the x's version to version zero point ninety

97
12:24.940 --> 12:25.290
here.

98
12:25.290 --> 12:33.310
We don't need to update the bootstrap version since we have the newest version which is four point three

99
12:33.310 --> 12:33.790
point one

100
12:40.140 --> 12:42.430
and then in Pittsburgh unit the next m l.

101
12:42.560 --> 12:49.660
We need to replace this envy with server overload.

102
12:49.700 --> 12:54.810
Not changes us up on PSP union

103
12:59.080 --> 13:08.800
that select all of these and replace with server.

104
13:10.410 --> 13:21.080
Here we don't need the SPG directory we add this directory when upgrading to liberal version 5 and 7.

105
13:21.170 --> 13:23.460
But now it no longer needed.

106
13:23.480 --> 13:30.310
So let's go back to where Ed navigate to public directory

107
13:33.600 --> 13:34.680
and remove this directory

108
13:45.220 --> 13:45.780
next.

109
13:45.790 --> 13:47.530
Here we can skip this read me file

110
13:50.350 --> 13:52.540
also list up the Charles

111
13:58.780 --> 14:01.480
as well as bootstrap the chess

112
14:05.250 --> 14:12.010
and then here inside resources Lang and password at Bisbee.

113
14:12.040 --> 14:18.230
We need the change the Arab us a message from six to eight.

114
14:29.120 --> 14:34.270
And instead of validation here new validation error message added.

115
14:34.900 --> 14:36.160
So let's copy this line

116
14:47.810 --> 14:51.130
and paste here.

117
14:52.430 --> 14:59.720
Next in underscore variables not SC s s probably we could ignore this change because it only replace

118
14:59.990 --> 15:02.390
the double code to single quote

119
15:06.570 --> 15:11.320
and in paying for it it replace the capital D with a lower D

120
15:16.520 --> 15:27.580
and then in update SPSS the number bar lawful says US rule no longer needed so let's open up.

121
15:27.710 --> 15:28.830
Note SPSS

122
15:34.360 --> 15:35.500
and remove this lens

123
15:46.680 --> 15:47.380
anything.

124
15:47.430 --> 15:48.600
That's all we need.

125
15:48.630 --> 15:54.780
We have upgraded our up to a literal version of five point eight in the next video we'll make some test

126
15:54.900 --> 16:00.750
to verify that our application still working as before and here.

127
16:00.780 --> 16:02.360
Don't forget to several changes

128
16:07.290 --> 16:14.250
and then let's switch to me terminal and then let's type npm install.
