00:01.230 --> 00:07.380
As a final step let's go to Github compression tools
to see other changes that possibly not covered

1
00:07.410 --> 00:08.750
in this guide.

2
00:08.880 --> 00:14.460
As I mentioned before the changes that are not covered 
in this upgrade guide could be not required.

3
00:14.880 --> 00:21.300
So this lesson possibly optional to you and you can 
skip this but if you want to make sure that your

4
00:21.300 --> 00:25.520
project's files in sync you can follow this lesson.

5
00:25.560 --> 00:28.680
All right let's go to GitHub comparison tool

6
00:32.210 --> 00:39.380
and here we can ignore these dot editor config by hitting this icon.

7
00:39.380 --> 00:47.100
Also this dot env example dot git ignore and

8
00:52.880 --> 01:00.730
here in register controller file there is a bit 
changes in validation rules in the prior version

9
01:00.740 --> 01:06.900
the rules are written in string while a new version  it's written in array.

10
01:07.800 --> 01:13.450
It's no problem if you not update but in 
this case I prefer to change these to array.

11
01:13.920 --> 01:19.630
So I'll hit this icon and view file in New tab

12
01:25.490 --> 01:27.170
here I'll copy this lines

13
01:31.790 --> 01:35.230
back to my editor open register

14
01:35.240 --> 01:35.880
controller

15
01:41.330 --> 01:46.880
and replace this validation rules. Back to our browser

16
01:54.290 --> 01:54.960
here

17
01:55.130 --> 02:01.280
verification controller added in new version and 
we have already added so we can hide this

18
02:05.970 --> 02:08.890
now in kernel dot php file

19
02:09.090 --> 02:20.010
there is a bit change in auth. Previously it referred to 
eliminate of middleware authenticate class but now it

20
02:20.010 --> 02:23.640
referred to app http middleware

21
02:23.670 --> 02:25.020
authenticate class

22
02:30.900 --> 02:39.090
so back to our editor then open kernel in app http folder

23
02:44.960 --> 02:45.230
here

24
02:45.260 --> 02:49.730
let's change the auth key to refer to app

25
02:53.070 --> 03:01.130
http middleware authenticate. Back to our browser

26
03:01.530 --> 03:09.360
we have added the verified key so let's 
copy only this middleware priority

27
03:16.160 --> 03:19.510
back to our editor and here

28
03:20.560 --> 03:22.850
let's paste the code here.

29
03:29.630 --> 03:30.740
Switch back to our browser

30
03:37.720 --> 03:40.890
and here let's copy entire code in this file

31
03:47.140 --> 03:51.080
back to our editor navigate to

32
03:53.870 --> 04:03.460
http middleware create new file and call it authenticate

33
04:08.330 --> 04:10.570
inside this file just paste the code.

34
04:17.660 --> 04:19.420
All right back to our browser

35
04:24.030 --> 04:36.260
hide this file and here in verify csrf token we 
will find new property called add http cookie

36
04:36.290 --> 04:37.120
copy this line

37
04:42.380 --> 04:43.970
back to our editor

38
04:44.490 --> 04:45.770
find

39
04:45.770 --> 04:46.430
Verify

40
04:46.440 --> 04:50.850
csrf token and paste the code

41
04:54.570 --> 04:57.310
head over to our browser

42
04:57.840 --> 04:58.850
hide this file

43
05:03.360 --> 05:08.220
also this file because as you can see is only switch the method

44
05:08.220 --> 05:08.790
position.

45
05:12.830 --> 05:18.920
we have updated this file so we can also skip this file.

46
05:19.120 --> 05:23.100
We've also updated this app user

47
05:23.100 --> 05:32.140
but here we'll find casts property defined contain 
email verified at so let's copy these lines

48
05:35.220 --> 05:40.220
back to our editor open user php

49
05:43.290 --> 05:44.180
and paste here

50
05:47.800 --> 05:49.420
switch back to our browser

51
05:52.170 --> 05:53.110
hide this file

52
05:55.990 --> 06:06.130
now here there is a bit change in bootstap app.php previously it call real path and so on like this

53
06:07.910 --> 06:13.120
but now it call dollar underscore env

54
06:13.170 --> 06:13.890
blah blah blah.

55
06:14.420 --> 06:15.960
So let's copy this line

56
06:20.450 --> 06:21.490
back to our editor

57
06:23.480 --> 06:28.670
open app in bootstrap folder

58
06:33.220 --> 06:34.000
and here

59
06:34.060 --> 06:39.290
let's replace this line.

60
06:39.420 --> 06:41.280
Hit this file

61
06:41.290 --> 06:43.830
also this file because we've updated it

62
06:43.830 --> 06:44.370
this file

63
06:49.720 --> 06:51.860
now in config app.php

64
06:51.870 --> 06:54.940
there is a big change in comment

65
06:55.180 --> 06:57.640
I don't care with this

66
06:57.670 --> 07:00.850
instead I'll copy this asset url

67
07:06.940 --> 07:11.780
open app.php in config

68
07:14.690 --> 07:18.000
and I'll place beneath this URL

69
07:25.040 --> 07:26.330
also copy these lines

70
07:34.690 --> 07:36.850
and I'll paste below this one.

71
07:48.470 --> 07:49.190
All right

72
07:49.340 --> 07:52.610
for the rest of the config files I won't talking anything

73
07:52.610 --> 07:54.440
and maybe I'll fast forward the video

74
10:12.920 --> 10:13.410
OK

75
10:13.540 --> 10:21.370
here in user factory we need to import the eliminate support SDR.

76
10:21.600 --> 10:28.810
That's copy this land back to our editor sir.

77
10:29.260 --> 10:30.060
Factory

78
10:41.430 --> 10:49.080
then we need to replace this as the random too as TR Colin Colin random

79
11:09.460 --> 11:10.280
no Hillary.

80
11:10.310 --> 11:14.870
We need to update the depth dependencies for our assets.

81
11:14.870 --> 11:17.720
The first one is a lot of Onyx.

82
11:17.810 --> 11:29.180
We need to change to four point all point seven then we need to update the villages version to two point

83
11:29.400 --> 11:31.270
five when 17

84
11:53.910 --> 11:56.300
and then we need to add these three lines

85
12:13.570 --> 12:16.870
here in PSP units we the to change

86
12:19.820 --> 12:25.370
the Q driver to Q connection and the value is still the same

87
12:38.480 --> 12:38.980
right

88
12:42.170 --> 12:44.720
we can skip this file.

89
12:45.040 --> 12:50.000
Also this file and the SPG folder

90
12:56.260 --> 13:10.090
we don't need this file also this file and here in resources jazz up the jazz there is a big change

91
13:10.450 --> 13:12.260
in registering component.

92
13:12.310 --> 13:19.180
Maybe we don't need to update these abilities but just to note that when registering compiling using

93
13:19.180 --> 13:24.250
require a function make sure you check in with default

94
13:36.190 --> 13:37.590
now in Misrata.

95
13:37.600 --> 13:42.640
Yes that's a big change when requiring proper chess.

96
13:44.900 --> 13:47.390
So now it's inside the tri cache

97
13:55.800 --> 13:56.910
so I spoke these

98
14:00.150 --> 14:01.740
inside here

99
14:07.420 --> 14:09.220
we don't need to change these file

100
14:12.520 --> 14:13.330
also.

101
14:13.330 --> 14:14.170
This file

102
14:19.060 --> 14:20.350
and for the validation

103
14:22.950 --> 14:30.340
I think we don't need to change anything because squalid change in space

104
14:36.510 --> 14:37.950
yeah we can skip this file

105
14:45.640 --> 14:48.300
we don't need this file.

106
14:48.530 --> 14:56.660
Also this file this file and here we've already update this file.

107
14:56.820 --> 14:57.390
All right.

108
14:57.490 --> 14:58.690
I think that's all we need.

109
14:59.560 --> 15:10.490
We can now go back to our editor and several file changes.

110
15:10.690 --> 15:12.260
Now we can go back to our terminal

111
15:16.590 --> 15:24.920
and run into m run dev to install dependency packages for our asset.

112
15:25.060 --> 15:29.380
Sure I get error because I've updated some packages versions.

113
15:29.640 --> 15:36.870
Also add three new packages so the fix this way to run npm install

114
15:44.820 --> 15:50.340
the next video we are going to test our app and make sure all functionality still working properly.
