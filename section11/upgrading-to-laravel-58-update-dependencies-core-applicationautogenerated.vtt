00:01.100 --> 00:08.480
In this lesson I'm going to show you how to upgrade laravel app from Version five point seven to version five

1
00:08.490 --> 00:09.380
point eight.

2
00:09.450 --> 00:17.010
And as always here I have already opened the upgrade 
guide from laravel official documentation as reference.

3
00:17.010 --> 00:22.810
Like I said in the previous upgrade guide, to upgrade 
Laravel app you can follow in two different options.

4
00:22.920 --> 00:31.500
You can read and follow every step from the top all 
the way down or you can go to bottom open this

5
00:31.650 --> 00:32.880
github comparison tool

6
00:36.130 --> 00:41.110
hit file changes and compare those changes

7
00:41.120 --> 00:41.870
side by side

8
00:45.020 --> 00:45.860
in this lesson.

9
00:46.160 --> 00:52.490
firstly we'll follow the first option because by using 
this we will know what changes that we need and

10
00:52.490 --> 01:00.950
don't need to play in our app and how those changes 
impact our app. And then when we reach at the end of

11
01:00.950 --> 01:08.480
the guide we'll be using the Github comparison tool 
to see some changes that may be not required and

12
01:08.500 --> 01:10.130
not covered in upgrade guide

13
01:10.340 --> 01:13.880
but just to make sure that our application's files are in sync.

14
01:15.130 --> 01:15.630
Okay

15
01:16.010 --> 01:22.950
let's open up our terminal and change the 
working directory to our Laravel app.

16
01:23.120 --> 01:29.630
And as always let's isolate our work into new branch 
so we can always revert back to a previous version

17
01:29.630 --> 01:32.480
just in case we are got unwanted error after upgrade.

18
01:36.320 --> 01:41.720
here I'm going to call it laravel dash v

19
01:41.970 --> 01:44.300
five point eight.

20
01:48.140 --> 01:49.280
All right

21
01:49.480 --> 01:53.990
back to Laravel guide. Let's jump to the top

22
02:01.490 --> 02:02.220
and here

23
02:02.760 --> 02:08.870
let's begin by updating the dependencies. Here we 
need to update Laravel framework dependency to five

24
02:08.980 --> 02:11.040
point eight.

25
02:11.250 --> 02:18.330
Also we need to examine any third party packages 
that consume by our app and verify we are using

26
02:18.330 --> 02:22.050
the proper version for laravel 5.8. To do this

27
02:22.050 --> 02:23.640
Let's head over to our editor

28
02:26.400 --> 02:32.770
open composer.json. Then here

29
02:32.780 --> 02:38.960
let's change the laravel framework vision to five point eight.

30
02:39.170 --> 02:43.630
Let's see what else that we need to 
change in this file back to our browser.

31
02:46.330 --> 02:54.920
Go to Github comparison tools then find composer.json.

32
02:57.190 --> 03:08.860
Here we need to update Nuno maduro collison form 
version 2 to version 3 and php unit from version

33
03:08.860 --> 03:27.450
7.0 to 7.5.

34
03:27.470 --> 03:34.610
Here we have laravel debug bar but currently 
the version 3.2 is still the current version. So we

35
03:34.610 --> 03:36.600
don't need to change this.

36
03:36.630 --> 03:38.810
All right let's save the change

37
03:41.460 --> 03:42.580
back to our terminal.

38
03:44.600 --> 03:50.060
And here let's update our dependency packages by typing composer

39
03:50.430 --> 03:50.940
update

40
03:54.120 --> 03:55.210
while it's updating

41
03:55.260 --> 04:00.510
we can head over to Laravel upgrade 
guide and follow the next step.

42
04:02.410 --> 04:09.960
Let's see the application contract section. Here in the 
environment method because we did not implement

43
04:10.050 --> 04:12.630
this contract so we can skip this.

44
04:16.220 --> 04:19.370
Then here we see added methods

45
04:20.550 --> 04:27.240
to illuminate contract foundation application. Again 
we did not implement this interface so we can

46
04:27.240 --> 04:31.450
skip this.

47
04:31.560 --> 04:32.850
Let's see the authentication

48
04:35.410 --> 04:43.020
here in password reset notification 
route parameter when using laravel 5.7

49
04:43.030 --> 04:51.880
The token is passed to the route helper without explicit name. But in a Laravel 5.8 the token is passed

50
04:51.880 --> 04:53.530
to the route helper explicitly.

51
04:55.960 --> 05:04.590
Here because we did not define the password 
dot reset manually so we can skip this. Next

52
05:05.170 --> 05:07.510
let's see new default password length.

53
05:07.930 --> 05:11.280
As you can see the likelihood of impact is high

54
05:14.040 --> 05:22.230
the required password length when choosing or resetting a 
password was changed to add characters. So let's switch

55
05:22.230 --> 05:23.460
over to our editor

56
05:26.490 --> 05:39.420
then open register controller. Here let's change 
this to eight and we don't need to do anything

57
05:39.590 --> 05:48.400
with reset password controller because the validation 
rules defined in Laravel framework. Back

58
05:48.510 --> 05:49.340
to our browser

59
05:54.450 --> 05:56.880
and here we can skip this cache section

60
06:00.920 --> 06:04.200
the likelihood of impact could be very height.

61
06:04.500 --> 06:08.610
But since we are not using this currently we can skip the section.

62
06:17.220 --> 06:19.050
here in collection section.

63
06:19.050 --> 06:24.780
The add method has been removed again since we did not extending the collection.

64
06:24.780 --> 06:32.980
We can skip this also we can ignore these for square method because we did not extending it.

65
06:35.580 --> 06:44.670
We can skip this console section as well as container.

66
06:44.850 --> 06:53.460
Let's see the data section and quoted my sequel JSON values likelihood of impact is low the query builder

67
06:53.850 --> 07:02.130
will no return and quoted JSON values when using my sequel and more IDB we can skip this

68
07:05.720 --> 07:12.690
single light likelihood of impact medium so if you're using all the sequel version.

69
07:12.950 --> 07:22.400
Make sure you update it to second version three point eight point eight or higher migration in big increments

70
07:24.590 --> 07:26.050
level 5 when 8.

71
07:26.080 --> 07:33.970
Now using big increments method on 80 columns definition this method produce unsigned big integer primary

72
07:33.970 --> 07:38.380
key are increment as noted here.

73
07:38.390 --> 07:41.750
This will not affect any existing code in our project.

74
07:41.780 --> 07:47.560
Just to be aware that 4 in your column must be of the same type probably in a prior version.

75
07:47.600 --> 07:55.340
We were using unsigned integer to define our foreign key but now we need to define it as unsigned big

76
07:55.400 --> 07:55.910
integer

77
07:59.400 --> 08:00.810
now in all connection.

78
08:00.850 --> 08:08.640
We can skip this it's physically fix the monthly words model names ending to be correctly pluralist.

79
08:12.740 --> 08:16.940
Here we can also skip this because we did not use a custom before to model

80
08:20.270 --> 08:21.440
the load count method.

81
08:21.560 --> 08:27.250
Edit in a lock and model since we did not define this such method we don't have to worry about this

82
08:30.180 --> 08:43.280
we can skip this one this one and this one next in environment verbal passing now the hash symbol will

83
08:43.280 --> 08:45.220
be considered as a command.

84
08:46.010 --> 08:55.640
So in the previous version if you define the reveal value as full hash bar then you have the value as

85
08:55.700 --> 08:59.900
it is through hash bar.

86
08:59.900 --> 09:07.300
But now if you define the same value you will have only foo because hash bar 3.

87
09:07.340 --> 09:14.990
Ask men so to preserve the previous behavior you have to wrap the values in quotes.

88
09:15.310 --> 09:19.900
I'm sure I don't have these values so I'll move on to the next section

89
09:23.070 --> 09:25.900
here we can skip this event section.

90
09:26.050 --> 09:27.850
It's also the exception handling

91
09:34.890 --> 09:35.850
now in male.

92
09:35.860 --> 09:42.480
There was a change in modern file directory so if you have placed well overall smackdown.

93
09:42.570 --> 09:47.110
Male components using vendor call and published command.

94
09:47.130 --> 10:00.390
You should rename the resource vs vendor male market and directory to text and so on we can skip this

95
10:04.190 --> 10:06.410
and then we can skip these cute section

96
10:11.550 --> 10:12.290
these requests.

97
10:12.300 --> 10:12.860
Also

98
10:16.270 --> 10:17.310
routing as well

99
10:20.000 --> 10:21.200
and Sessions

100
10:26.770 --> 10:28.410
now here in support section.

101
10:28.410 --> 10:34.280
We can see that whole array and as the Oracle Little Helper has been deprecated.

102
10:34.760 --> 10:44.360
So now we should use eliminate support R for array and eliminate support stream for string.

103
10:44.450 --> 10:48.610
For example we used to call as the r underscore slug.

104
10:48.650 --> 10:51.780
Now we should call as the r Colin Cullen.

105
10:51.860 --> 11:00.610
Select here id say the impact of this change has been marked as medium so the helper has been moved

106
11:01.660 --> 11:09.880
to the new or for helper package which overs a backwards compatibility layer for all the global array

107
11:09.910 --> 11:11.530
and string functions.

108
11:11.530 --> 11:13.090
So let's hit this lean

109
11:20.490 --> 11:20.880
copy.

110
11:20.880 --> 11:22.610
This cancels in command.

111
11:23.100 --> 11:24.560
So we stole our terminal

112
11:27.460 --> 11:31.030
paste and hit return back to upgrade guide

113
11:34.180 --> 11:38.250
and here we can skip this this one

114
11:43.180 --> 11:45.100
let's also skip this testing

115
11:47.630 --> 11:48.530
validation

116
11:52.950 --> 11:53.490
and view

117
11:56.770 --> 12:00.770
and then here in notification the likelihood of impact is high.

118
12:02.560 --> 12:09.270
The next small and select notification channels has been extracted into first part of packages to use

119
12:09.270 --> 12:11.870
these channels in your application.

120
12:12.240 --> 12:14.600
Require the following packages.

121
12:14.960 --> 12:21.370
So let's copy this command switch store terminal paste.

122
12:25.590 --> 12:28.590
Copy the package name from the second command

123
12:33.300 --> 12:37.230
in a space paste and return

124
12:40.930 --> 12:41.320
all right.

125
12:41.580 --> 12:47.640
While it's installing we can go to get hub comparison tool and see other changes that could be not cover

126
12:47.640 --> 12:48.870
in this gate.

127
12:48.930 --> 12:50.670
But this step is could be optional.
